## What Are Affirmations and How Do They Work?

Affirmations are positive statements designed to challenge and replace negative or unhelpful thoughts. By consistently repeating these phrases, you can rewire your brain to focus on constructive beliefs. The power of affirmations lies in their ability to influence your subconscious mind, shaping how you think and act. With regular practice, they can help improve confidence, reduce stress, and foster a more optimistic outlook.

When practicing affirmations, it’s essential to focus on the present tense and use language that resonates with you. Speak them aloud, write them down, or repeat them silently in your mind. Repetition is key, as this helps your brain internalize these messages. Pairing affirmations with visualization can amplify their impact, helping you align your thoughts and actions with your goals.
