Here’s a list of the 20 [greatest quotes](/the-greatest-quotes-of-all-time) (well according to me anyway!) about time passing too quickly.

1.  “Time does not pass, it continues” – Marty Rubin
2.  “Our life is made up of time. Our days are measured in hours, our pay measured by those hours, our knowledge is measured by years.

Life must never be over until all is over!” – Ernest Agyemang Yeboah
