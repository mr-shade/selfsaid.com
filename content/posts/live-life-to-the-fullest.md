Do you feel that you are not making the most of life? Do you feel you are missing out on a fulfilling social life, loving relationships, exciting adventures, or thrilling experiences? Do you want to make a change? Are you ready to [live life to the fullest](/how-to-live-life)?

Here is a list of 22 tips I use to try and [live my best life](/how-to-live-your-best-life), They work well for me and have helped me build and live a life that I truly love. Try them for yourself and watch your life change for the better.

## 1\. Be positive

Being positive is not just a pleasant way to live, it’s the only way to live. Positive thinking means that you approach stressful situations with a [positive outlook](/how-to-keep-a-positive-outlook-in-life). It’s being able to look beyond a crisis rather than being consumed by it and only expecting the worst.

It brings optimism into your life and makes it easier to avoid the worry and stress of negative thinking. Benefits include better psychological and physical well-being, longevity, happiness, and the ability to enjoy life.

## 2\. Live every day as the first day of the rest of your life

Don’t be concerned with what happened yesterday, last week, or last year. Don’t worry about what other people are doing and don’t compare yourself to them. Today is a brand new start. Each morning focus on living your best life and enjoying the experiences along the way.

## 3\. Stop worrying about the future

It’s normal to worry from time to time, but excessive worrying will not change the future. It will though stop you from living your life to the fullest now.

Learning relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing can help you get the symptoms of chronic worrying under control. When you constantly worry about the future, you are not able to live in and enjoy the present moment.

## 4\. Stop putting areas of your life on hold

Most people are not even aware that they’re doing so, they just put their life on hold subconsciously, and suddenly they realize they’re a lot older and not satisfied with their life. Do you want to travel, write a book or join the circus? Make it happen! Tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.

## 5\. Learn to live in the moment

Most of us have a tendency to either live in the past thinking about what happened yesterday or worrying or planning for the future. To live in the now means not dwelling on the past, nor being anxious or worrying about the future.

Don’t watch as life passes you by. Jump in and get involved in all that is happening around you at this moment. Life is to be experienced.

## 6\. Create your life handbook

A life handbook is your guidebook on how to live your best life. It should consist of your life purpose, your life goals, and a plan on how to achieve these objectives. They might be simple goals you want to achieve today or this week, or longer-term 1, 3, or 5-year goals.

Create an action plan on how you are going to achieve these goals. Then take action. Regularly review your life progress. Assess your progress every week, month or year so that you know you’re making headway to achieving your objectives.

## 7\. Don’t be afraid of failure

Have you ever been so afraid of failing at something that you decided not to try it at all? Allowing fear to stop you from taking advantage of opportunities as they present themselves in life means you are likely to miss some great experiences along the way.

If you want to be afraid of something, be afraid of not having tried. The only way to avoid failure is not to try. But then you’ll miss out on the incredible experiences life has to offer.

## 8\. Let go of your past

Our past experiences can have a major impact on our lives. How often do you feel that you can’t move on because of past events? No matter how hard you try, you find yourself living in the past. Don’t let whatever happened in your past influence your present life. Instead, focus on the present and enjoy what today has to offer.

## 9\. Don’t settle

Don’t settle for a job you hate. Don’t settle for friends that put you down. Don’t settle for a partner you don’t love. When you settle for less than you deserve, you’re setting yourself up for an unsatisfying life filled with limitations and future regret. Settling is giving up on your dreams, aspirations, and goals. Never stop pushing forward. Go get what you want from life.

## 10\. Face your fears

We all have fears that drive or impact our behaviors and stop us from living our lives to the fullest, but the benefits of facing your fears are immense. After facing a few of your fears you’ll soon build the courage to face more. And most importantly, you’ll [expand your comfort zone](/10-ways-to-step-out-of-your-comfort-zone) and enjoy new and exciting experiences you never thought possible.

## 11\. Practice an attitude of gratitude

[Practicing gratitude](/how-to-cultivate-an-attitude-of-gratitude) can be life-changing and has the potential to actually change your perspective on life. Express gratitude and appreciation in all areas of your life, for both the big and small things. By doing so, you’ll be able to replace discontent with contentment. Feeling gratitude can make you healthier, strengthen the immune system, [reduce stress](/how-to-reduce-stress), increase emotional resilience and allow you to enjoy what life offers you today.

## 12\. Learn to forgive others

When someone or an event hurts you, you can hold on to resentment and anger or embrace forgiveness and [move forward](/quotes-about-getting-back-up-and-moving-forwards-after-failure) in your life. Studies have found that the act of forgiveness can make you physically and mentally healthier. It can reduce blood pressure, anxiety, depression, and stress, leaving you to enjoy life to the fullest.

## 13\. Create a bucket list

Create a bucket list of the goals you want to achieve, experiences you wish to accomplish, and dreams you want to fulfill during your lifetime. A bucket list will help bring a personal/work balance to your life, It will ensure you make time for the things you love or enjoy doing and increase your happiness and lead to a more fulfilling life.

## 14\. Be true to yourself

This means living your life in accordance with who you are and what you believe. Stop pretending to be someone you’re not. Living an honest life will make you feel fulfilled, pretending to be someone else will seriously curb your happiness. Don’t be afraid to be who you are!

## 15\. Stop complaining about your problems

Complaining is a normal part of human communication. Often we complain without even realizing it, but complaining is rarely helpful. Excessive complaining can increase your stress level and develop a culture of negativity leading to anxiety and depression.

Instead, choose to focus on the positive aspects of your life. As you focus more on maximizing your gratitude and [excitement about life](/7-ways-to-make-your-life-exciting-again), you will increase your level of overall life satisfaction.

## 16\. Don’t wait for an opportunity to come knocking on your door

Be creative and make opportunities happen. If you just wait for the next great adventure to happen in your life, then you may find yourself waiting for a while. As the American actor and comedian Milton Berle famously said, “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door.”

## 17\. Live a simpler life

Life can certainly be complicated, but sometimes we make it more complicated than it needs to be. [Simplifying our lives](/simple-living-how-to-live-a-simple-life) can reduce stress, free up valuable time and help us to feel more in control of our destiny. If you are searching for happiness and a fulfilling satisfying life, let go of unnecessary baggage, and focus only on the things that are most important to you.

## 18\. Declutter your home

[Decluttering your home](/declutter-your-home) can free your mind, lower stress, and reduce anxiety. Taking the time to create a peaceful living space can improve your overall sense of well-being. Studies have shown clutter is linked to overall life dissatisfaction. Decluttering will leave you more in control of your life and more able to accomplish your life goals.

## 19\. Be kind

Kindness has a remarkable ability to transform our surroundings and our lives. [Practicing kindness](/simple-acts-of-kindness-that-can-make-us-live-longer) helps create a better life full of love, hope, and happiness.

## 20\. Do only the things you love doing

The one simple thing you can do to optimize your life is to only do what you love. Life is short. If possible, don’t do things you don’t like doing. Spend time only on what makes you happy and fulfilled. Doing what you love will make you more productive and closer to living a satisfying fulfilling life.

## 21\. Stay away from negative people

[Stay away from negative people](/stay-away-from-negative-people). This can include people who take advantage of you, people who don’t respect you, and overly critical or negative people. Studies have shown that spending time with negative people can have undesirable effects on our motivation, happiness, and wellbeing.

Even a brief encounter with a toxic person is enough to have a negative impact on our life. Decide today that you’re not going to allow negative people to determine how you think, feel, and behave by avoiding them. Instead, focus your time and energy on living your very best life.

## 22\. Seek out positive like-minded people

Mix with people who encourage you, respect you and make you happy. As Jim Rohn said: “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” If you surround yourself with positive people, those qualities will help push you to be better, achieve more, and live a fulfilling life.
