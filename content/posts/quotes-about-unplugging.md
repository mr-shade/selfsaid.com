In today’s fast-paced, digitally-driven world, the concept of ‘unplugging’ has become more than just a luxury; it’s a necessity for maintaining our mental and emotional well-being. To unplug means to consciously detach ourselves from the constant buzz of technology and the daily stressors that keep us perpetually connected and often, inadvertently, disconnected from ourselves. This practice of stepping back, of taking a breather from our screens and gadgets, isn’t just about avoiding digital overload; it’s about rediscovering the joys and tranquility of the non-digital world.
