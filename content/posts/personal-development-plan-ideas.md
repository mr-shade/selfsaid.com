## 4\. Make a list of your short term, midterm, and long term life goals

Making a list of your short-term, midterm, and long-term goals helps you stay focused on what you want to achieve. It gives you a clear sense of direction and allows you to track your progress over time. By breaking down your goals, you can manage your time and energy more effectively, leading to personal growth.

## 5\. Create an action plan on achieving those goals

Creating an action plan for your goals helps you break down what needs to be done into [small manageable steps](/how-to-break-a-big-task-into-small-steps). It keeps you organized and motivated by giving you clear tasks to complete. By following your plan, you can steadily work toward achieving your goals, leading to meaningful personal development.

## 6\. Become optimistic

Developing an optimistic outlook is a life-skill that will improve anybody’s life. Optimism is a habit and we can actually train ourselves on [how to be optimistic](/how-to-be-optimistic). By changing our way of thinking we can gradually change our mood, motivation level and become more optimistic.

## 7\. Be kind

Researchers have been studying the psychology and biology of positive social interactions and have been finding extraordinary results. Performing simple [acts of kindness](/simple-acts-of-kindness-that-can-make-us-live-longer) not only makes you feel good, but they may also increase your lifespan.

This is according to recent studies by scientists and academics at UCLA’s Bedari Kindness Institute. It seems that simple acts of kindness can have powerful psychological and sociological effects. They can actually change our bodies, our minds and the world around us.

Learn to live with less and you’ll soon be reaping the benefits of more living space, fewer allergens and less stress. You’ll enjoy a boost in creativity and [productivity](/tips-for-productive-living) and have more free time. You’ll sleep better, concentrate better and best of all – there’ll be less cleaning to do!

## 9\. Live every day with an attitude of gratitude

An [attitude of gratitude](/how-to-cultivate-an-attitude-of-gratitude) improves physical and psychological health. It improves self-esteem, enhances empathy and increases emotional resilience.

## 10\. Make time for a hobby

When was the last time you made time to do something just for you? A hobby is a great stress reliever and can offer new experiences and challenges. It can make you learn new skills and achieve things you thought not possible thus improving your self-confidence and self-esteem. Some hobbies can improve memory and increase concentration.

## 11\. Start drinking a cup of green tea every day

Green tea is said to be the healthiest drink on the planet. It is packed with nutrients and antioxidants that can improve brain function and make you smarter. Green tea also increases fat burning, improves physical performance and may lower the risk of some types of cancer.

## 12\. Learn to say no

Stop saying yes every time someone asks you for something or for your help and start learning [how to say no](/learn-how-to-say-no). Saying no is a vital self-development tool to learn for your health and well-being. You’ll have more energy and more time for yourself. And you’ll gain respect from others and gain self-confidence.

Procrastination is the postponement of something that we know we should do now. We all procrastinate from time to time, some people more than others.

## 14\. Exercise every day

I imagine everybody knows that exercise is an important part of staying healthy. Benefits include lower blood pressure, lower cholesterol level and lower risk of diabetes and some cancers. Stronger bones, muscles, and joints. More energy, better sleep and an improved feeling of well-being.

## 15\. Stop multitasking

According to research by the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask), you may feel you’re being more productive by multitasking, but you’re probably not.

## 16\. Start a daily stretching routine

Stretching should be part of every training program. It decreases muscle stiffness and increases range of motion. It also helps reduce or manage stress, improves posture and reduces the risk of injury from sudden movements.

## 17\. Live in the present

Now is the only time we ever experience. Unfortunately, most people live either in the past or are waiting for the future to make them happy. Do your best to live in the present moment more often.

## 18\. Drink more water

Did you know that adult humans are 60 percent water, and our blood is 90 percent water? Incredible! To function properly, all the cells and organs of the body need regular water. Keeping hydrated is crucial for your health and general well-being.

The benefits of drinking more water include helping maximize physical performance, helping to relieve constipation, increasing brainpower and providing energy, flushing out toxins and helping to regulate your body temperature.
