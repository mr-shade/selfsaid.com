In our day to day lives, it’s tough to be honest 100% of the time. Every day, we are presented with situations where we can either tell the truth or lie, but consistently telling the truth is not an easy path to take.

Saying nothing at all, telling a ‘white lie’ or telling a big lie may often seem the best option, but the benefits of telling the truth far outweigh any short-term advantages of lying. So what are the advantages of always being honest with people? Here is a list of the 8 major benefits of telling the truth:

## 1\. You don’t have to remember your lies.

Once you have told a lie, you need to remember that lie so as not to contradict yourself in the future. This can create a state of [anxiety](/48-simple-ways-to-reduce-stress-and-anxiety) as you worry about being in a situation where you could be ‘found out’. If you never lie, you don’t need to worry about your lies being discovered and you’ll live a happier, less anxious life.

## 2\. You’ll earn trust and respect.

Constantly telling the truth will earn you trust and respect from friends, family, and work colleagues.

## 3\. You’ll create deeper connections with people.

Telling the truth shows a willingness to express your feelings and private thoughts openly. This behavior encourages others to reciprocate, deepening [friendships](/how-to-be-a-good-friend) and relationships.

## 4\. You’ll feel more confident.

Being truthful with other people means we are also being truthful with ourselves. We can take pride that we are not betraying our own thoughts or beliefs which can build our self-confidence. If you are interested in building confidence, please read my article on [how to appear confident](/10-ways-to-appear-more-confident).

## 5\. Trust creates opportunities.

If a work colleague is aware that you are not always truthful, they will not be able to trust you and will be guarded in their dealings with you. If your colleague believes you are an honest person and to be trusted, friendship, information, and opportunities are more likely to flow your way.

## 6\. Lying takes energy.

Every time you need to decide whether to tell the truth or lie and if you decide to lie, what will the lie be, you are using energy. If you are facing this dilemma multiple times a day it can be both mentally and physically taxing.

## 7\. You won’t get caught lying.

Getting caught lying is embarrassing. If you always tell the truth you can’t get caught out!

## 8\. Truth attracts truth.

100% truthful people are rare in today’s society and are an important and valuable commodity. People who tell the truth are instinctively drawn to other honest speaking people. Being honest can bring you better quality friends and acquaintances.
