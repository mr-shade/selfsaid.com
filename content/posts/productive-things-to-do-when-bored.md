What is boredom? Boredom is a sign that your life is maybe too comfortable or too easy. You probably feel that you don’t have anything in particular to do, or maybe life is just too tedious.

It’s at these times when you can use boredom as an opportunity to improve your life, like setting new life goals and a plan on how to implement those goals, or perhaps learning a new skill. There are so many productive things you can do when you are bored that can change your life forever.

So with the goal of becoming a better, more productive person, here is a comprehensive list of 20 productive things to do when bored.

## 1\. Organize Your Life With Planners.

Feeling bored? This could be the perfect opportunity to start planning a new and exciting life! But wondering where to begin? Try planners and trackers. If you’re looking to better manage your time or set up a productivity schedule, these tools can be really helpful.

No matter your age or where you are in life, learning new skills is always a great idea. Did you know learning something new can benefit you more than just giving you a practical skill?

As well as being fun to look around, museums are a great learning environment. They inspire, make you smarter, and can help you change your perspective. It is a very productive way to relieve boredom.

## 6\. Set Short And Long Term Goals.

Setting goals is a powerful way to inspire and motivate yourself to achieve new things. The main benefits of setting goals are that they provide you with a clear destination and the direction needed to reach them. They help clarify what’s important to you and give you control over your future. This is a great strategy to consider if you’re looking for productive activities to tackle when you’re bored.
