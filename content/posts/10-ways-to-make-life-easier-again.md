Life doesn’t need to be complicated but most of us have a tendency to make it more difficult than it needs to be. But before we can start making life easier, we need to decide what ‘living a simple life’ actually means.

For me, it means spending more time with the people I love and who make me happy, which are my family, friends, and pets, and also doing more of the things I love doing.

With regards to my job and chores, an easier life means performing these tasks in a non-stressful and hopefully enjoyable way. It makes me more effective, less stressed, I have more energy and I feel happier.

If your world is feeling way too hectic and out of control, here are 10 suggestions on how you can start simplifying your life and make life easier again starting from today.

## 1\. Think before you begin

Need to redecorate a room or remodel your bathroom? Planning out a task before you begin will help the work run smoothly, stress-free and simplify the experience.

## 2\. Tackle small problems before they become big problems

Have you noticed a little water appearing from under the shower basin or perhaps you have a small leak in the guttering? Fixing these small issues as soon as you notice them can stop them from becoming bigger expensive life complicating problems in the future.

## 3\. Keep it simple

Whatever the task, not overcomplicating the process will certainly help to simplify life.

## 4\. Tell the truth

Telling lies, even white lies can seriously over complicate your world. Once you tell a lie you often have to cover up that lie with more lies. When you always [tell the truth](/8-remarkable-benefits-of-always-telling-the-truth) you never have to remember what you said and to whom and life will become so much simpler and easier.

## 5\. Prioritise your tasks

Prioritise your job list by importance and then work on the important tasks that will benefit you the most.

## 6\. Perfectionism

[Perfectionism](/how-i-cheated-my-need-for-perfectionism) and setting unreachable goals for yourself that you won’t be able to accomplish can cause you frustration, depression, and high levels of stress. Setting the bar lower to a level you can easily achieve will make life easier.

## 7\. Outsource

Do you have to complete every task yourself? If possible, pass on unimportant tasks to other people to free up your time so you can spend it with the people you love or the things you love doing.

## 8\. Disconnect The Internet

The internet is probably one of our biggest distractions and can interrupt our work, ruin productivity, enable procrastination and leave us feeling stressed. Want to make your work life easier? I know this is scary, but if you don’t need to be online to work, [disconnect the internet](/quotes-about-unplugging)!

Having a [good night’s sleep](/how-to-fall-asleep-fast) means you’ll [feel refreshed](/ways-to-feel-refreshed) and alert and able to face the day’s challenges with a calmer attitude and less stress.

## 10\. Stop multi-tasking

If increasing efficiency is not a priority, try focusing on one task at a time and finish it before moving onto your next job. You’ll not only be more productive, but you’ll also complete each task faster, your stress levels will drop and life will become easier.
