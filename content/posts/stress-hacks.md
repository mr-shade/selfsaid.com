I used to think stress relief had to be big, dramatic, or at least structured. Yoga classes. Breathwork routines. A weekend off-grid.

And sure, sometimes those things help, but when I was most overwhelmed, I didn’t need another project. I needed relief that fit into the middle of a messy, overstimulated day.

So I started noticing what actually helped. Not in theory, but in practice. What made my shoulders soften. What slowed my breath. What pulled me out of my spiraling thoughts, even just for a moment.

These aren’t life-changing strategies. They’re small, quiet shifts. But when I do them, I feel more human.

Here are 15 stress hacks that help me stay grounded, even when life doesn’t slow down.

## 1\. Drink water slowly

Not while multitasking. Not while scrolling. Just one glass of water, sipped like it matters. When I actually pause to drink it slowly, it’s like giving my nervous system a signal: “You’re allowed to take a breath.” For more on this, read [The Surprisingly Grounding Power of Drinking Water](/grounding-power-of-drinking-water).

## 2\. Put your phone in another room

Even for 20 minutes. You’d be amazed at how much quieter your brain feels when you’re not half-expecting a notification. It’s like stepping out of a constant conversation and into your own mind again. I wrote about this habit in [How to Start a Phone-Free Hour (Even If You’re Addicted)](/phone-free-hour).

## 3\. Do one thing slowly on purpose

Fold clothes, make tea, wash your face – just _slow down one thing_. Slowness interrupts autopilot and brings me back into my body. It helps me feel like time isn’t always slipping through my fingers. You can learn more in [Doing One Thing Slowly: A Self-Care Practice for Busy Minds](/doing-one-thing-slowly).

## 4\. Lay down on the floor for five minutes

No goal. No music. Just let your body soften into the ground and breathe. It’s strange how supportive the floor can feel when I let myself actually rest there.

## 5\. Light a candle and watch the flame

It sounds small, but it gives your brain something gentle to focus on. Watching a flame flicker can be surprisingly soothing, like meditating without trying to meditate.

## 6\. Say “no” to one thing today

Even something small. You’re allowed to protect your time. Every time I say no, I say yes to a little more space. If you struggle with this, my book [Learn How To Say No](/learn-how-to-say-no) walks you through how to say it without guilt.

## 7\. Write one sentence in a journal

Not a page. Not a recap. Just one honest line about how you feel. It’s a way of checking in with myself without turning it into a task. I share how this habit changed my mindset in [One-Line Journaling: The Habit That Actually Stuck](/one-line-journaling).

## 8\. Step outside even if it’s just the front step

Fresh air, natural light, and a sky that’s bigger than your to-do list. Even 60 seconds outside can shift the mood. Nature has a way of helping me breathe differently.

## 9\. Stretch your arms overhead and breathe out audibly

That release? It’s nervous system gold. I don’t always realize how tense I’ve become until I hear the sigh leave my own mouth.

## 10\. Do a 60-second tidy

Pick one surface. Clear it. No pressure to finish the house. Just one small pocket of peace can change how a room, and my mind, feels.

## 11\. Hold something warm

A mug of tea. A heat pack. The warmth alone tells your body it’s safe. It’s a kind of comfort that doesn’t need any words.

## 12\. Say something kind to yourself (out loud)

Even if it feels silly. Especially if it does. Some days, hearing “You’re doing your best” out loud is the only thing that shifts my inner monologue.

## 13\. Do nothing (on purpose)

Sit. Don’t scroll. Don’t fix. Don’t optimize. Just exist for a minute. It’s strange how powerful stillness can be once I stop resisting it. See also: [The Case for Doing Nothing: How Stillness Became My Self-Care](/the-case-for-doing-nothing).

## 14\. Exhale longer than you inhale

This calms the vagus nerve and tells your brain: we’re okay. I often do it without anyone knowing, even in traffic or in a tense meeting. It’s a tiny secret reset.

## 15\. Ask yourself: “What do I need right now?”

Don’t overthink it. Just listen. Trust that the answer matters, even if it’s something simple, like rest, quiet, or a snack.

You don’t need all 15. You don’t need to do them every day. Just try one.

In a world that moves fast and asks a lot, these are my gentle ways of saying: _I’m still here._
