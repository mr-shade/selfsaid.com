My phone is the first thing I reach for in the morning and the last thing I put down at night – at least, that’s how it used to be. I’d tell myself I was just checking the time or replying to a message, but somehow, 30 seconds turned into 30 minutes.

It wasn’t just the time I was losing. It was my focus, my calm, my presence.

I didn’t want to quit my phone entirely. I just wanted to feel like I was in charge of it, not the other way around. So I tried something small: one phone-free hour a day.

It felt impossible at first. But eventually, it became one of the most grounding parts of my [self-care routine](/create-a-self-care-routine-that-works).

## Why I Needed a Phone-Free Hour

*   I was tired of being mentally “on” all the time
*   My attention span was getting shorter by the day
*   I wanted to reclaim some part of my life that didn’t involve swiping, refreshing, or scrolling
*   I missed stillness, silence, and space to think

This wasn’t about punishment. It was about peace.

## How I Started (Without Going Cold Turkey)

1.  **I picked a consistent time.** For me, it was the hour after dinner. I was already winding down, and it felt like a natural break.
2.  **I set my phone in another room.** Out of sight, out of mind. If I left it nearby, I’d reach for it without thinking.
3.  **I gave myself something to do instead.** Not a to-do list, just a gentle activity. Reading. Journaling. Washing dishes. Sitting in silence. [Doing one thing slowly](/doing-one-thing-slowly) made the hour feel like a gift, not a punishment.
4.  **I didn’t expect it to feel amazing right away.** It was uncomfortable at first. I felt restless and twitchy. But that discomfort passed, and what came after was calm.

## What Changed (And What Didn’t)

*   I still use my phone. I just don’t feel so tied to it.
*   My thoughts feel less scattered.
*   I sleep better.
*   I spend more time doing things I actually enjoy.

I won’t pretend I never break the rule. I do. But this one small habit, one phone-free hour, has created more presence and peace than any productivity hack I’ve tried.

## If You Want to Try This Too

Start with 20 minutes if an hour feels like too much. Pair it with a grounding habit like [drinking water with intention](/grounding-power-of-drinking-water) or [writing one line in a journal](/one-line-journaling).

You don’t have to do it every day. Just enough to remember what it feels like to be _with yourself_, without a screen in the way.

\> This is one of several habits in my [Everyday Self-Care Routine](/everyday-self-care-routine), alongside other gentle practices like a [five-minute morning reset](/5-minute-morning-reset) and [the case for doing nothing](/the-case-for-doing-nothing).
