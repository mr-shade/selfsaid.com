Anxiety can feel like noise in the mind – thoughts racing, heart pounding, peace slipping out of reach. But even in the middle of it, calm is possible.

These 60 quotes are reminders that you are not your anxious thoughts. You can pause. You can breathe. You can come back to yourself.

Each section offers a different kind of calm, whether you’re looking for reassurance, clarity, or just a moment to feel less alone.
