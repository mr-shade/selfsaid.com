Everyone has experienced it at some point—delays that throw off plans and cause frustration. Whether it’s procrastination or external factors slowing things down, delay can hinder progress. Here are 18 strategies to tackle delays and keep moving forward and slay the day, every day:

## 1\. Break Tasks into Smaller Steps

Tackling large tasks can feel overwhelming, which can lead to delays. [Break your goals down into smaller, manageable steps](/how-to-break-a-big-task-into-small-steps). This makes progress feel more achievable and helps you maintain focus.

## 2\. Set Clear Deadlines

Deadlines create a sense of urgency. Assign specific timelines to tasks, even for personal projects. Having a clear endpoint can help [eliminate the temptation to postpone work](/how-to-eliminate-distractions-at-work).

## 3\. Prioritize Tasks

Identify the most important tasks on your list and focus on those first. Often, delays happen because time is spent on less essential work. By prioritizing, you ensure that the critical tasks are completed on time.

## 4\. Use a Timer

Set a timer for 25-30 minutes and focus on one task during that time. This technique, often called the Pomodoro Technique, helps you concentrate fully and prevents distractions from pulling you away from your work.

## 5\. Remove Distractions

Identify what commonly distracts you—whether it’s your phone, social media, or background noise—and [remove those distractions while working](/how-to-eliminate-distractions-at-work). Creating an environment conducive to focus can drastically reduce delays.

## 6\. Get Started, Even If It’s Small

Getting started is often the hardest part of any task. Even if you only have a few minutes, do something to begin the work. This initial action can often build momentum and lead to more progress.

## 7.Limit Perfectionism

[Perfectionism](/how-i-cheated-my-need-for-perfectionism) can be a major cause of delay. Striving for flawless results can prevent you from completing tasks in a timely manner. Aim for progress, not perfection, and make improvements later if needed.

## 8\. Use a To-Do List

Writing down tasks can help keep you accountable. Use a to-do list to organize what needs to be done and check off items as you complete them. The satisfaction of checking off tasks will motivate you to keep going.

## 9\. Set Boundaries

Sometimes, delays happen because you take on too much. [Learn how to say no](/learn-how-to-say-no) to tasks or requests that don’t align with your priorities. This helps you focus on what truly matters and avoid overcommitting.

## 10\. Break the Task Cycle

If you feel stuck or keep delaying something, change how you approach the task. Adjust your routine or try a different method. A fresh perspective can help eliminate the sense of stagnation.

## 11\. Delegate Where Possible

If you’re responsible for multiple tasks, see if there are any that you can delegate to others. By offloading some responsibilities, you’ll free up time to focus on tasks that require your direct attention.

## 12\. Reward Progress

Motivation can be boosted by rewarding yourself for completing tasks. After finishing a difficult or lengthy project, take a break, enjoy a treat, or do something that helps you relax and recharge.

## 13\. Visualize Success

Picture the result of completing the task and how it will benefit you. Keeping the end result in mind can encourage you to keep working through delays and get closer to the finish line.

## 14\. Focus on Energy, Not Time

Manage your energy levels by scheduling tasks when you feel most alert and productive. For some, this may be early in the morning, while others work better later in the day. Align your tasks with your peak energy times.

## 15\. Avoid Multitasking

Multitasking can make you feel busy without making significant progress. Focus on completing one task at a time to avoid splitting your attention, which often leads to delays.

## 16\. Identify and Address Fears

Sometimes delays are caused by fear—fear of failure, fear of judgment, or fear of the unknown. Identifying and addressing these fears can help you move past the hesitation and get back on track.

## 17\. Plan for Breaks

Working without rest can lead to burnout and ultimately more delays. Plan short breaks to refresh your mind. Even a five-minute walk or stretch can reset your focus and improve productivity.

## 18\. Commit Publicly

Accountability is a [powerful motivator](/motivational-quotes-success). Tell someone you trust about your goals or tasks. The external pressure of someone knowing your commitments can help you stay on track and push through delays.

Using these strategies can help reduce delays, make tasks more manageable, and keep you moving forward. Implementing even a few of these steps can make a big difference in [staying productive](/tips-for-productive-living) and on schedule.
