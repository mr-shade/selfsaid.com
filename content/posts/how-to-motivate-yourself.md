Do you ever wake up feeling that you simply can’t face the day? Maybe you don’t feel like doing anything but you know that spending the day sitting on the couch watching TV just isn’t an option.

Sometimes it can be hard to get ourselves up and out of a chair, working through our tasks and achieving everything we want to achieve. No matter how strong a work ethic we have, some days we just need a little help to get going. It’s at these times you need to know how to motivate yourself.

A lack of motivation can occur for a number of reasons such as boredom, being overwhelmed by a large workload, lack of sleep, personal issues, lack of direction or a failure to set goals. Even the prospect of venturing out to an office on a cold [rainy day](/rainy-day-quotes) can quickly dampen our enthusiasm. This is when we need a few tricks to get us out of a slump and back on our feet. Here are ten [self-motivation techniques](/12-proven-self-motivation-techniques) to help motivate yourself back to work.

## 1\. Focus on one goal at a time.

Working on more than one task at a time can be intimidating, tiring and can curb your best efforts to accomplish any of them. It is difficult to retain the energy and focus needed to work on multiple projects. Try prioritising your to-do list from the most important to the least important and start working through the list one job at a time.

## 2\. Break large projects into small manageable steps.

Preparing to undertake a large overwhelming project can make it feel like it’s a good time to stop work and go do something more fun! You know you should get started but you just can’t quite motivate yourself to begin. It’s all too easy to lose sight of your goal when you are being psychologically crushed in the details of how to achieve your objective. The manner in which a task is presented has a significant impact on how motivated you will be to take action.

The solution? Break the task down into [small manageable steps](/how-to-break-a-big-task-into-small-steps). When a large project may appear completely overwhelming, breaking it down into smaller steps can be calming and make it seem less intimidating and far more manageable. Try it and you’ll soon find your motivation increasing.

## 3\. Listen to inspirational music.

This is a simple technique but can be very effective, as long as your work allows you to listen to music. Having music that you find inspiring playing in the background (while you work or just before) can motivate you to get off the couch and start achieving your goals.

## 4\. Write down your goals.

It’s not easy to motivate yourself if you’re not clear on your objectives. Get yourself a sheet of paper and write down your goals and how you are going to achieve them. Having a plan of action can [focus your mind](/how-i-cultivated-a-focused-state-of-mind) and motivate you to get started.

## 5\. Keep track of your progress.

Keep a list of tasks that need accomplishing and tick off each goal that you achieve. Just having a visual log of completed tasks can inspire you to continue.

## 6\. Set a quit time.

If you are self-employed you probably don’t have a typical 9 to 5 workday. You will probably push on until either the task is finished or you are too exhausted to continue. Try setting a time when you will finish work and you’ll likely feel more motivated to start.

## 7\. The 5-minute rule.

This is a great habit to get into that will get you attacking your to-do list, whether or not you feel motivated. Here’s how it works – if the job takes less than five minutes to perform, do it straight away. Yes, it really is that simple!

There are many day-to-day tasks that take less than 5 minutes that we routinely put off to another time as we just can’t get the enthusiasm to start them. Of course, not every project takes less than five minutes, but by following this strategy you’ll form a habit that will serve you well every day of your life.

You’ll complete a lot of small tasks whatever your motivation levels and have the satisfaction of ticking them off your to-do list. If you find there are too many and feel over-faced with the sheer number of small jobs, simply list them by priority and work your way down through. Your motivation levels will soar, I can almost guarantee it.

## 8\. Remind yourself of the end result.

Sometimes when you’re immersed in a tough project you may find yourself forgetting what you were setting out to achieve. Try visualizing the end result and think about how you’ll feel when you accomplish it.

## 9\. Change your environment.

Working in the same location day after day can cause boredom and malaise. Changing your environment may be all that is needed to boost your motivation levels. Are you self-employed and work on a laptop? Try working outdoors or from your car parked in a beautiful location. If you can’t change location try redecorating or getting new office furniture, pictures or pot plants.

## 10\. Take a break.

Working too much will dampen most people’s enthusiasm. Taking a break can often be enough to recharge your batteries and allow you to attack your work with a new vigor.

Try these techniques until you find your personal formula for self-motivation. You’ll soon find you have the motivational boost you need to get you over your next slump and back to work.
