**\> Feeling burnt out? Subscribe to my [**Everyday Self-Care Newsletter**](/newsletter) for self-care tips and doable habits that support your well-being.**

  

We all carry habits of thinking and behaving that quietly wear us down. Some of them started long ago, picked up from family, culture, or past experiences. Others have become automatic responses to stress and pressure. These [habits](/habits-that-waste-our-time) may seem small, but over time they drain your energy, increase anxiety, and make life feel heavier than it needs to be.

Letting go of them is not about perfection. It is about noticing where you are being unkind to yourself, and choosing something gentler instead. With awareness and practice, these small shifts can help you feel lighter, calmer, and more at peace with yourself.

Here are ten things you can begin to release today.

## 1\. Stop being so hard on yourself

The way you speak to yourself matters. If you constantly criticise, you reinforce feelings of failure and pressure. Think about whether you would speak to a close friend the same way. If the answer is no, it is time to soften your inner dialogue.

Instead of replaying mistakes, remind yourself of your effort and progress. Swap phrases like “I always fail” for “I am learning as I go.” Over time, these small changes replace self-criticism with self-support, allowing you to grow without the weight of judgment.

## 2\. Stop comparing yourself to others

In today’s world, comparison is everywhere. Social media makes it easy to measure your life against carefully curated snapshots of someone else’s. But comparison rarely brings clarity or motivation, it usually leaves you feeling inadequate.

Remind yourself that what you see in others is not the whole story. Everyone has struggles and setbacks hidden from view. Focus on your own journey, your own pace, and the progress you have already made. Your path does not need to look like anyone else’s to be worthwhile.

## 3\. Stop saying yes when you mean no

It can feel easier in the moment to say yes to requests, even when you are tired or stretched thin. People-pleasing may keep the peace, but it often leaves you resentful and exhausted. Each time you agree to something that feels wrong, you are saying no to your own well-being.

Practice pausing before you answer. Give yourself a moment to check in with your true feelings. Saying no can be kind, respectful, and freeing. Boundaries protect your energy, which means you can say yes more wholeheartedly when it really matters.

## 4\. Stop living in the past

Dwelling on regrets or replaying old hurts only keeps you stuck. While the past holds lessons, it is not a place to live. When you notice yourself revisiting old mistakes or disappointments, gently bring your focus back to the present moment.

Ask yourself: what small step can I take today that supports me? The past cannot be changed, but today is always available. Allow yourself to learn from yesterday, then release it so it does not colour every new experience.

## 5\. Stop expecting perfection

Perfection is a standard that does not exist. Chasing it keeps you trapped in constant dissatisfaction, unable to feel proud of what you achieve. You may delay starting projects, or spend endless hours refining work that is already good enough.

Instead, [focus on progress](/habits-blocking-progress). Celebrate completion, not flawlessness. When you let go of perfection, you make space for creativity, growth, and peace of mind. Life feels lighter when you aim for “good enough” and allow yourself to move forward.

## 6\. Stop ignoring your needs

Ignoring your body and mind’s signals eventually leads to burnout. Skipping meals, pushing through tiredness, or suppressing emotions are signs that you are putting yourself last. Over time, this neglect leaves you depleted.

Kindness means listening when your body says rest, when your mind says pause, or when your emotions say speak up. Meeting your needs is not selfish, it is the foundation that allows you to care for others without losing yourself.

## 7\. Stop carrying everything alone

Many people believe they must handle life without support. Asking for help may feel like weakness, but it is actually strength. Sharing what you are going through allows others to be there for you, and helps lighten the weight you carry.

Whether it is confiding in a trusted friend, leaning on family, or speaking to a professional, support makes the load easier. You do not need to prove your independence by exhausting yourself. Allow others to walk beside you.

## 8\. Stop explaining yourself unnecessarily

You do not have to justify your choices to everyone. Over-explaining often comes from fear of judgment, and it drains your confidence. You may find yourself rehearsing reasons for simple decisions, as if you need permission to live your own life.

Practice shorter answers. Try saying, “This is what feels right for me.” Respectful but firm responses remind you that your choices are valid without endless explanation. Your life is yours to live, not constantly defend.

## 9\. Stop filling every moment with busyness

Filling every gap in your schedule may feel productive, but it often hides restlessness or fear of slowing down. Without pauses, stress builds quietly until exhaustion takes over.

Give yourself space to breathe. Sit in silence, take a short walk, or simply allow a few unplanned minutes in your day. Rest and stillness are not wasted time, they are what restore your balance and help you return to life with more clarity.

## 10\. Stop believing you are not enough

This belief underpins many of the other struggles. The idea that you must constantly do more, achieve more, or be more in order to be worthy is exhausting. But worthiness is not something you earn, it is something you already have.

Challenge the thought when it appears. Remind yourself of your strengths, your resilience, and the ways you have already shown up for yourself and others. You do not need to become someone else to deserve kindness, care, and respect. You are enough as you are.

## Final Thought

Letting go of old habits does not happen overnight. You may notice yourself falling into them again, and that is natural. The important step is awareness. Each time you notice and choose differently, you begin to change the pattern.

Start small. Choose one of these habits and practice releasing it this week. With time, those small choices add up to big shifts. You will find yourself moving through life with more calm, more balance, and a deeper sense that you are worthy of care today, and every day.
