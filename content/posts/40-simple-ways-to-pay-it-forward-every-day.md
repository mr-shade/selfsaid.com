I love the concept of ‘paying it forward’ and practice it regularly. I figured most people knew of the idea but was surprised to learn recently that although quite a few of my friends had heard of the film ‘Pay It Forward’, they had never heard of the principle… so fast forward to this article where I explain the concept and a few suggestions on how you can put it into practice.

The idea behind ‘pay it forward’ is that when someone does something kind to you, instead of reciprocating the deed back directly, you pass it on to somebody else, hence the phrase, pay it forward. The theory is that not only will you make another person happy, you will also set in motion a chain reaction that can make a positive difference in the world.

Of course, you don’t have to wait until someone does you a good deed. You can be the one who sets it all in motion by performing the first [act of kindness](/simple-acts-of-kindness-that-can-make-us-live-longer). Need some inspiration?
