Positive affirmations are simple and usually short statements declaring specific goals, desires or wishes. Although they sound like simple messages, repeated over and over they can have profound effects on the conscious and unconscious mind.

First, they will change your thinking and then your reality. A positive affirmation has the ability to program your mind into believing the statement as the mind doesn’t know the difference between what is real or what is fantasy. Just doing a brief search online you’ll discover that many people swear by the power of affirmations to create positive changes in everything from relationships, love, finances, weight loss, careers, money, confidence, and [anxiety](https://seffsaid.com/26-positive-affirmations-for-anxiety/).

Neuroscience has in fact proven that our thoughts can actually change the structure and functioning of our brains. By regularly practicing positive thinking, it is possible to alter brain plasticity and neural plasticity (also known as [Neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity)) in the specific area of the brain that processes thought.

When first practicing positive affirmations, try picking one or two to focus on for several weeks. Repeat the affirmation in a confident voice several times throughout the day and before sleeping. You can add even more power to the affirmation by writing it down as you speak it.

Using daily positive affirmations is a proven method of self-improvement and an effective way to change our thought patterns. And therefore a valuable technique to move us towards achieving our goals and desires.

Below you’ll find a list of 100 of the most [powerful affirmations that can change your life](https://seffsaid.com/50-powerful-affirmations-that-can-change-life/).
