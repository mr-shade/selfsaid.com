Anxiety is a word that we encounter more and more in this modern, high-paced world. We all feel tense at times and we all have to be able to deal with stress and pressure, no matter our lifestyle and life choices. High-functioning anxiety is when a person is seemingly able to lead a normal life, despite high levels of anxiety. They suffer just as much, but they are high-achievers and their anxiety is, to most people in their lives, a hidden disability. This level of anxiety is incredibly common although it manifests in different ways in different people. Here are some of the warning signs that you may be suffering from high-functioning anxiety:

## 1\. You have uncontrollable anxiety but nobody else knows

Inside, your anxiety might be surging, yet on the outside, nobody would ever guess it. This is a key sign of high-functioning anxiety, where despite the internal struggle, you present yourself as completely composed and under control to the world.

The energy it takes to conceal this level of anxiety is substantial, as you’re constantly balancing the act of appearing calm while internally dealing with intense worry and stress. This discrepancy between your inner state and how others perceive you underscores the hidden challenge of living with high-functioning anxiety, making it a solitary battle that’s fought in silence.

## 2\. You are a perfectionist

To some, being called a perfectionist might seem like a compliment, but it’s not as positive as it sounds. This trait doesn’t mean performing tasks better than others but involves an excessive focus on minor details, leading to significant stress. Perfectionists are trapped in a cycle of worry over imperfections that most overlook, setting unrealistically high standards for themselves that are more draining than motivating.

The constant fear of error or not meeting these self-imposed standards can immobilize a perfectionist, driving them to over-prepare and overthink. This extreme attention to detail is a common indicator of high-functioning anxiety.

## 3\. You worry excessively

It’s natural to worry from time to time; it’s part of being human. However, when your worrying becomes constant and intense, dwarfing the actual significance of the events and situations you fret about, it might be a sign of an anxiety disorder. This kind of worry is not just the occasional concern over daily matters but a relentless, overwhelming wave that floods your day with anxiety.

If you find that worrying takes up a substantial part of your day and significantly impacts your ability to function in your daily life, it’s worth considering the possibility that this is more than just stress.

## 4\. You have trouble falling or staying asleep

Anxiety can significantly disrupt your sleep patterns, often making it challenging to either fall asleep or stay asleep throughout the night. Lying in bed, you might find your mind racing with thoughts, replaying every instance that caused you worry—be it from events that happened earlier in the day, fears about the present, or anxieties about the future. This pattern of sleep disturbance is a common sign of high-functioning anxiety.

## 5\. You can’t concentrate

When you’re dealing with high-functioning anxiety, the ability to concentrate takes a hit. This form of anxiety consumes a significant amount of mental energy with constant worrying, leaving little room for your mind to focus on the tasks at hand.

This level of distraction significantly undermines productivity and the ability to process information effectively. While you may seem to be handling your daily tasks competently on the outside, the ongoing battle to stay focused amid the relentless background noise of anxiety reveals the profound impact high-functioning anxiety has on cognitive functions and attention span.

## 6\. You suffer from constant negative self-talk

Many of us can indeed be critical of ourselves, but for those experiencing high levels of anxiety, this self-criticism intensifies into a relentless stream of negative self-talk. This internal monologue, often referred to as our “[inner critic](https://seffsaid.com/how-i-silenced-my-inner-critic/),” can be harsh and unforgiving, constantly highlighting flaws, mistakes, and inadequacies. This pervasive negative self-talk is a common symptom of high-functioning anxiety, particularly among those who strive for perfection in all aspects of life.

## 7\. You have physical pain

High-functioning anxiety isn’t just a mental challenge; it often manifests as physical pain. You might notice persistent headaches, muscle tension, or stomach issues that don’t seem to have a clear medical cause. These symptoms can be your body’s response to the constant stress and worry that accompany anxiety. While easily overlooked, such physical discomforts are significant indicators that your anxiety is taking a toll, not just on your mind, but on your body as well.

## 8\. You can’t relax

Finding it impossible to unwind is a common symptom of high-functioning anxiety. Even in moments meant for relaxation, your mind may be running at full speed, cycling through tasks, worries, and what-ifs.

This constant state of mental activity can make true relaxation feel out of reach, leaving you feeling restless or on edge even during downtime. It’s like your body forgets how to let go of the tension, keeping you in a perpetual state of alertness that prevents the calm and peace necessary for recharge.

## 9\. You’re irritable and impatient

When high-functioning anxiety is at play, you might find yourself more irritable and impatient than usual. Small inconveniences or normal delays can suddenly feel intolerable, sparking a quick temper or frustration over things that wouldn’t normally bother you.

It’s like your emotional threshold has been lowered, and the smallest triggers can set off a disproportionate reaction, reflecting the constant tension and stress you’re carrying inside.

## 10\. You seek reassurance from others

If you’re frequently looking for reassurance from those around you, it might be a sign of high-functioning anxiety. This need often stems from a place of self-doubt and a desire for validation that your actions, decisions, or feelings are appropriate or correct.

It’s not just about seeking advice; it’s more about needing constant affirmation to quell the anxiety-driven thoughts that you might not be doing well enough.

## Final thoughts

Remember that most of us worry from time to time and some of us worry a lot of the time. Each personality has its own patterns, its own triggers for tension, stress, and anxiety. But if you are suffering from on-going and overwhelming anxiety that is affecting your day-to-day life, you may be suffering from high-functioning anxiety. Whilst self-help can be very effective, you may need to also seek professional medical advice.
