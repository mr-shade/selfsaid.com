Just slowing down can make a dramatic change to the amount of stress you feel throughout the day.

## **3\. Be Silent**

Schedule five minutes a few times through the day when you disconnect yourself from the world. Turn off your phone, TV, radio, doorbell, tablet, and laptop. [Disconnect from the internet](https://seffsaid.com/quotes-about-unplugging/). Anything that makes a noise or can distract your mind. Then just sit back, relax, and enjoy the silence.

## **4\. Stop Procrastinating**

Everybody has a tendency to procrastinate, putting off unwanted tasks to another time or even forever. The problem with allowing work to pile up is that it can often lead to more problems that could have been avoided had the job been completed earlier, thus causing even more issues you need to solve and sending your stress levels through the roof.

## **5\. Take A Brief Walk**

Our bodies weren’t made to sit in a chair all day. Studies show that getting outdoors and taking daily exercise is a great stress reliever as well as all the other well-known health benefits. So make sure to do some physical activity every day – take a brisk walk, go hiking, ride a bicycle, take up a sport, etc. It doesn’t need to be an intense session to de-stress you, just get moving.

Try [decluttering](https://seffsaid.com/declutter-your-home/) by removing any unnecessary items from your desk keeping only what’s needed for your work in front of you.

## **8\. Eliminate Non-Essential Tasks**

Eliminating any jobs that are non-essential from your day will give you more time and energy to focus on the remaining important tasks and in turn reduce your stress. Also, consider which tasks you perform daily that stresses you the most. Weigh up the amount of stress caused by performing the task by the value to you of completing it. It’s quite possible some jobs just aren’t worth the anxiety they cause.

## **9\. Schedule Some Relaxation Time**

Relaxation is different for different people, one person may find rock climbing relaxing, another lying on the sofa [reading a book](https://seffsaid.com/8-benefits-of-reading-books/). Whatever your preference, making time to relax, and forgetting your worries is vital to managing stress.

## **10\. Get Enough Sleep**

Taking steps to [sleep well](https://seffsaid.com/how-to-fall-asleep-fast/) means you’ll start the day rested, refreshed, and less stressed. A few suggestions include eating a light dinner and not snacking during the evening and not looking at any screens an hour or two before bed.

## **11\. Avoid Difficult People**

We all have people in our lives who we find difficult to deal with or ask too much of us. They usually manage to push just the right buttons to make us feel stressed and anxious. If possible [avoid negative people](https://seffsaid.com/stay-away-from-negative-people/), or at least limit your exposure to them.

## **12\. Do One Thing At A Time**

Doing one thing at a time is the simplest and quickest way to start reducing your stress levels. No more multi-tasking, just perform one task at a time. Need to pay some bills, wash clothes or make dinner? Do only one of these jobs at a time. Preparing a meal while simultaneously making a phone call and loading the dishwasher is a recipe to send your stress levels through the roof. Focusing on just one task will take practice and some self-control, but keep practicing and your stress level will reap the benefits.
