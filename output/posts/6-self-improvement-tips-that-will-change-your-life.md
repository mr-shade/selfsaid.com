Do you ever feel you could be doing better in life? Maybe you feel you should be achieving more or experiencing more of the good things life has to offer? Most, if not all people, can stand to make a few improvements in their lives, to make them better versions of themselves.

We usually know the areas of our lives that need improving, but sometimes it can be difficult to make the first step to help our [personal development](https://seffsaid.com/12-personal-development-tips/). Well, you are in luck as I have put together for you today 6 simple yet powerful self-improvement tips that will [change your life for the better](https://seffsaid.com/change-your-life-for-the-better/).

## 1\. Stop buying things and start buying experiences.

For many people, modern life is a consumer-oriented experience. We are bombarded daily with advertisements telling us that happiness can be bought… if only we had a big TV, the latest tablet, an expensive car, a bigger house or expensive clothes. The trouble with buying things is that the happiness they provide fades very quickly.

So what’s the answer? Well, research has continually shown that experiences bring people more lasting happiness than possessions. Experiences actually become part of our identity. We are the accumulation of everything we’ve ever done, the places we’ve visited, the people we’ve met, and the relationships we’ve had. So if you want to improve your life and [be a happier person](https://seffsaid.com/7-ways-to-be-a-happier-person/), this is probably one the most powerful self-improvement tips you can know… stop buying things and start buying experiences.

## 2\. Start a regular stretching routine.

While the benefits of daily exercise are well known, the benefits of a regular stretching routine are just as important as regular exercise. Here are a few reasons your new self-improvement program should include flexibility training: Stretching exercises can [reduce stress](https://seffsaid.com/how-to-reduce-stress/) by loosening and relaxing tight, contracted muscles increasing blood flow and encouraging the release of endorphins.

Flexibility training can improve your range of motion and give you more flexible joints and lessen your risk of injuries. Stretching can also increase energy levels as muscles tighten when we get tired making us feel even more fatigued, performing a few stretches can help revitalize our energy levels. Adding stretching to your daily routine does not have to involve a huge time commitment, but flexibility training can end up giving you huge results!

## 3\. Start napping!

I have to admit that napping is probably one of my favourite self-improvement tips! In general, people are becoming more and more sleep-deprived. It is estimated that one in three of us suffer from inadequate or poor sleep. Unfortunately, the cost of sleepless nights is not just tiredness and a lack of concentration and focus. Regular lack of sleep can put you at risk of serious medical conditions such as heart disease, diabetes and obesity.

While naps do not make up for poor night time sleep, a 20 – 30 minute nap can help to improve performance, alertness, concentration and mood. Plus, you’ll be in good company! Famous nappers include [Winston Churchill](https://seffsaid.com/winston-churchill-quotes/), John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Thomas Edison, Napoléon Bonaparte, Stonewall Jackson, Ronald Reagan and Salvador Dali.

## 4\. Declutter your home.

For most of us our homes are full of things we don’t really need, and unfortunately, this excess of possessions can take a toll on our emotional, mental and physiological wellbeing. Issues include emotional stress when objects are associated with feelings of regret, grief or guilt. Mental drain, frustration and stress when you can’t locate an item you need. And too many obstacles around the home can cause you to trip and injure yourself. Excess clutter can also collect dust and mold that can aggravate asthma and allergies.

Well that’s enough of the downsides! So what are the benefits of [decluttering your home](https://seffsaid.com/declutter-your-home/)?

*   Most importantly, not only will you gain more space in your home, you’ll also gain more space in your head. You’ll feel more focused and relaxed as a decluttered home is far more relaxing to be in.
*   You’ll have more money! Buying stuff and especially stuff you don’t really need costs money.
*   You’ll have more time! If you are like me, whenever I want to purchase something, let’s say a new tablet, I’ll spend hours researching and reading reviews online. Then there’s the time setting it up, learning to use it etc. If you have less stuff, you’ll have more time.

Decluttering doesn’t mean you need to throw out or give away all your possessions, just the items you don’t need, use or want anymore.

## 5\. Read self-improvement tips, books or articles every day.

Reading self-help, personal development, inspirational, motivational and self-improvement tips and articles every day can uplift you and fill you with positivity. They can get you thinking about the choices you make and the lifestyle changes you need to make for better living. You’ll start to believe that you can achieve more and [live a happier more fulfilling life](https://seffsaid.com/how-to-live-a-happy-life/).
