# Digital Signage Management System: Case Study, Benefits & Components

29 Feb 2024

As we rapidly move towards digitalization, technology, and expertise have led to the invention of exciting devices and software that one would have never imagined a few years ago.

[Digital signage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signage) is an excellent example of how organizations use unique ways to market themselves and reach their target audience.

But what seems to be a bright and illuminated billboard or screen takes a lot of understanding to ensure maximum utilization of digital signage management systems.

Today, we will discuss the details of digital signage, understand how this technology works, and how it is set to revolutionize the digital world.

## What is a Digital Signage System?

To manage digital signage solutions and run it successfully across various screens, one needs digital signage software where the desired content can be displayed in a loop and changed whenever required. It is indeed an incredible technology that every brand is using these days.

With an effective management system, handling huge LED signage boards becomes easy. Therefore, remote accessibility and convenience are definitely some benefits.

A well-designed signage system allows single or multiple content players to simultaneously run content across several screens.

## Use Cases of Digital Signage System

Even though SmartSign is used by several organizations across various industries, some sectors use this system efficiently to serve different purposes apart from marketing. Here are the major sectors where the digital signage control becomes a priority:

### Hospitality

Hotels, resorts, and restaurants aim to create memorable and seamless customer experiences. They aim to attract clients and expand the customer base via positive feedback. Word-of-mouth marketing and advertising have a crucial role to play in this industry.

Hence, in this digital age, the signage system is an excellent way as the interactive touchscreens let guests perform activities like check-in, navigate, get information, and check out within a few clicks. Restaurants use exciting digital signage features to design interactive menu boards, making them interesting and easy for visitors.

### Corporate

Even though the digital signage system is promoted as a marketing tool, corporate offices use it best for their internal operations, such as communicating with the employees. The audio-visual integration and usage of signage solutions at strategic locations inside the office facilitate better communication.

The signage displays are used at receptions for welcoming guests and also for announcements that keep employees in the loop regarding events and activities happening in the office. The offices have efficiently used the signage displays to highlight the sales and desired goals so that every person is on the same page and works towards achieving the best outcomes.

There are displays communicating real-time meeting schedules so that everyone stays prepared and attends the meeting without fail.

### Retail

The retail industry makes the best use of the SmartSign signage system as many people go online. Retailers now aim to attract customers by elevating the in-store shopping experience, and digital signage is one of them. The digital boards are used to advertise merchandise and schemes interactively.

The technology allows outlets to use online and social media content to make the display enjoyable. Some brands have installed display screens where customers can navigate through different products and sizes in-store and check prices and stock availability, saving a lot of time and effort.

### Education

Institutions use digital signage to enhance student engagement and inform them about recent updates. They use audio-visual integration for effective and quick digital signage notifications.

The message boards and advertising screens are extensively used to highlight the latest achievements of the institutions at the entrance or reception to let visitors know more about the institute.

### Public sector

Government organizations also use web-based digital signage to enhance customer service standards, streamline processes, and improve communication without spending a fortune. The digital signage system is about creating a positive public image while carrying the core values forward.

Hence, digital signage is extensively used to improve response time to individuals who have queries or wish to opt for particular services that can be quickly completed via the touchscreens. Tag renewals, bill payments, form filling, and more services are going digital, which has levelled up the efficiency of organizations’ manifolds and ensured a positive response from users.

## Features of Digital Signage System

SmartSign is a complete digital signage management system with a modern design and useful features that institutes, organizations, and businesses can use to achieve their goals and increase brand value with minimum effort. Here are some salient features of the signage system that make it excellent to other available versions:

### ESP8266 driven PWM LED

The ESP8266 microchip used in the signage system enables seamless internet connectivity, which comes with Wi-Fi capabilities that most other systems lack. Also, the chip can control multiple LED drivers simultaneously without any impact on the light intensity; hence, the output is impressive. An ESP8266 digital signage helps detect faulty LED drivers and renders regular updates for maintenance and upkeep on the web and mobile application.

### Web and mobile applications

The modern-day signage system can be leveraged as a web and mobile application as per the user’s convenience, making control accessible from any part of the world.

The Super admin panel manages admins and chooses their accessibility rights while using the system. It helps maintain a defined user profile and data security, which is of utmost importance in these digital times. The admin panel in the system can add signage and locations at his discretion while managing the technicians who take care of the essential functions of the signage system. Down the line, the technicians can connect every signage using a unique key to manage installations and set up connectivity via Wi-Fi.

### Content control and scheduling

When the technology was new, there were several digital signage challenges that SmartSign has overcome effectively. Now, admins can switch individual signage on-off according to needs, making it easy to operate. There are dimmer settings that can be used to set the LED brightness, and it can also be scheduled, ensuring that the user’s involvement is minimal after setting up the system.

### Fault Detection and Notifications

The digital signage fault detection feature has a crucial role since users are remotely accessing the system, and detecting faults in such a situation may be impossible. The system displays information like faulty transformers and displays in the web panel so that required action can be taken as soon as possible. If the user has not been using the system’s web panel for some time, an automatic email highlighting the issue is sent to the registered email, which is a great feature.

### Hardware Prototype

The efficiency of any software depends on the quality and compatibility with the hardware. SmartSign has handled every minute detail by developing a working prototype based on ESP8266. This ensures smooth and uninterrupted functioning of LED screens with minimal breakdowns.

### Server Setup for MQTT Message Transfer

With the MQTT digital signage, SmartSign enables effortless transfer between mobile applications, web panels, and hardware devices, which gives the user an upper hand while using the signage management system since he can choose according to his needs.

### Wi-Fi Connectivity and LED Indication

The digital signage system shows the Ethernet and Wi-Fi connectivity status for devices, so in case of any issues, the user can immediately take steps, identify the problem, and rectify the glitch.

The easy-to-use user interface and modern yet simple features make the signage system an ideal platform for organizations worldwide.

### Remote control

As digitalization is growing and is expected to be the trend, it will become a task to ensure physical monitoring of signage as thousands work in different parts of the world. Thus, the role of a signage system becomes crucial in such times as it gives admins the liberty to perform functions like dimmer settings, scheduling the signage, and updating the content with the help of the application.

### Quick notifications

The SmartSign signage system is well-equipped to detect and report any faults in transformers or displays, which is instantly conveyed to the user on the web panel as well as with an email so that the concerned person can take necessary steps for rectification.

### Easy connectivity

The signage system can be easily connected to a Wi-Fi connection or Ethernet and indicates the connectivity status with LED indications, making it easy to monitor.

## Key Takeaways

Every organization and business should prepare for the future, and going digital will be the top strategy, but the real differentiator is the company’s approach.

For example, in the digital signage system, choosing a platform that comes with full functionality and compatibility, along with security, should be the priority. Hence, the decisions made today will have a direct impact on the future.
