    2.  #### **[Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/xamarin)**
        
          
        
        ![Xamarin](/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Xamarin.png)
        
          
        
        Xamarin is backed by Microsoft, and this is enough for most of the app developers to go with it. With the help of C# codebase, it is pretty easy to develop Android, Windows, and iOS apps. The best feature of Xamarin is that it allows code sharing options on multiple platforms, which means that the same code can be used on various platforms without any hassle. Xamarin has a cloud service, which makes it one of the best cross-platform mobile app development tools.
        
          
        
        Xamarin is equipped with standardized UI controls, and there is no need for the developers to use any kind of extra UI option either.

## **Key Takeaways**

We hope that this comparison of the mobile app development tools will be helpful for development stakeholders. Requirement and budget of the client are two other factors that one has to take into consideration for picking which mobile dev tools are right for your app.

Tools like Android Studio are not suitable for developing hybrid or iOS applications; they are meant for only Android applications alone. So, if you are trying to develop an app for only an Android device, then this tool is perfect for you. Likewise, depending upon your requirements, you can pick the right kind of app. Your budget will become a key factor too.

The open source mobile app dev tools are an essential part of the development process. It not only speeds up the development, but it also reduces a lot of efforts on the developer’s part with the help of various interesting plugins.

However, not every tool is fit for the development process. The developers have to choose wisely here. There are a lot of factors that will impact their choice here, and one such factor is the project size. Not every tool is perfect to handle huge projects, so the developers have to make a smart choice here and pick the tools that will go perfectly with their app development.
