# Why Choose React Native for Mobile App Development?

22 Feb 2023

The current market for mobile application development is extensively growing and maturing. As per [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276623/number-of-apps-available-in-leading-app-stores/), over 3.5+ million apps are obtainable in the Google Play Store, while there are 1.6+ million apps accessible in the App Store.

At first sight, there may be only two primary choices for reasons to choose [React native](https://reactnative.dev/) app development: developing apps based on Android for the Google Play Store or developing apps based on iOS for the App Store. It was correct for a considerable amount of time.

However, there is now a third alternative available: the development of cross-platform apps. When this is the case, to enable the strategy for developing apps that run on several platforms successfully it is better to use the React Native mobile development framework.

In addition, we will demonstrate in this blog how it operates and discuss the advantages of utilizing React Native for the development of mobile applications.

## What is React Mobile App Development?

According to [Verified Market Research](https://www.verifiedmarketresearch.com/product/cross-platform-and-mobile-advertising-market/), the market for developing React native app examples that work on many platforms is expected to reach $364.54 billion by 2028. This kind of enormous leap is made possible by the advancing technology for the development of mobile apps, and React is one of the tools in this specific category.

As a declarative programming system geared at the building of native mobile applications on top of a JavaScript base, the initial version of React was made available for download by Facebook in 2013. In its most basic form, the React family consists of two members: [ReactJS and React Native](https://technostacks.com/blog/react-vs-react-native/).

## What is ReactJS?

The year 2013 saw the development of the first version. There is a number of [React component libraries](https://technostacks.com/blog/react-component-libraries/) available that programmers may use to create web pages compatible with any mobile-based device and any operating system (OS) that may be installed on a specific device.

## What is React Native?

The year 2015 saw the creation of the second iteration of the program. React Native provides developers with a framework that enables them to build native applications for both iOS and Android.
