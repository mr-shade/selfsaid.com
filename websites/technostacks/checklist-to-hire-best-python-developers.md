# Top Checklist to Hire Python Developers: A Definitive Guide

01 Apr 2022

In today’s times, one simply cannot use the word “Technology” without thinking about the different programming languages. These markup languages are making interfaces smoother than ever, and the development in the field is highly competitive.

Across computer programs, even the basic software, are updated using these languages, and some of the most used ones are Java, C++, JavaScript, Ruby, and Python.

[Python](https://www.python.org/) is gaining ground, and it is becoming one of the most preferred languages of the tech world. The codes generated are easy to read and logical to suit any kind of project, either large or small. Given that the language is simple and clear, software developers are using it to achieve control and management, accomplish their targets, and make testing effortless.

As the field is expanding, many developers are surpassing expectations that make them desirable as a valuable asset to a tech conglomerate.

### Checklist to Hire Professional and Proficient Python Developers

Hiring a Python developer can be viewed as a grating task by many since there are so many job-seekers skilled in this particular language. But worry not! Below we have created a guide on how to look for and [hire Python developers](https://technostacks.com/python-development-company/) experienced enough to suit your company’s needs and expectations. Read on to find out the “How” factor and create your checklist to hire some great Python developers!

1.  **Reflect on the goals set by the company and the need for a developer**  
    Hiring dedicated python developers will require you to have a clear goal in your mind regarding the position and also the expectations you have from the chosen employee.This objective will be passed onto the person acquiring the job via clear communication and will play an essential role in deciding the person’s worth to the organization. So, don’t be afraid to introspect and research!
2.  **Note down all the necessary qualifications required by the prospective candidate**  
    After arriving at an informed decision, jot down the company’s expectations as also what it has to offer to the job-seeker.The popularity of Python developers is on the rise, and it’s essential to publicize how the company can assist their personal growth while having the code for the organization’s functioning. Having over-the-top expectations isn’t necessarily a hassle. However, it does mean having to compromise a little at the end. Hence, it’s essential to be attentive while listing the requirements.
3.  **Rank the required abilities in preferential order**  
    Once you have finished with the portfolio requirements, it’s vital to sort through and prepare a final draft that has been ordered descending.For example, the most crucial skill a Python developer must possess is having a good command of the language and also being completely sound with the technical aspects related to it.Python consultants must know how to navigate the coding arena seamlessly, and this can be the top priority for the hiring company. Interpersonal communication skills, team-building virtues, leadership qualities, and responsible attributes also find a way in this list, not far below the technical aspects.
4.  **Make sure to elaborate specifically on the Python experience a candidate must possess**  
    A Python developer’s experience in the field matters during times of technical difficulties. It is also what hiring companies must look for in potential candidates. Some of the most basic features in the field are [python web frameworks](https://technostacks.com/blog/python-web-frameworks/), and the most popular ones for python are Flask and Django.Without them, a developer’s scope in the field is highly diminished. Understanding of the front-end technologies should also be sought, for it focuses on the developer’s ability to diversify and pick up new stuff related to the branch. The recruiter needs to understand that there needs to be a balance between the two components: Experience and a significant skillset. Without one, the other can be quite unsteady!
5.  **Publish interview calls and target the right audience**  
    How do you advertise widely for a position effectively and that too, at a low cost? As ludicrous as it may sound, it’s completely possible! Social media is booming, and since it’s available free of charge, advertising via different social media platforms will help attract a wider audience and help find the right fit for the job instantly!Platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram are being used successfully by many global companies to advertise their brand and search and hire resources across the globe.
6.  **Conduct a proficiency test to assess technical capability**  
    Resumes are effective to let the talent scout know about the worth of a particular applicant, but what about the candidate’s genuine responses to real-life situations? Or their ability to think on their feet during a written test?These can be analyzed by administering the initial contenders a simple yet meaningful test to explore the depth of their knowledge regarding the language. This scenario effectively checks the Python developer’s capability, which is not too tedious and provides instant results. Make sure to get the tests drafted by an expert in the field to avoid making any mistakes!
7.  **Move on to the interview round**  
    Interviewing the prospective candidates will help determine the perfect fit for the company. During the interview, try to analyze the interviewee’s knack for dealing with difficult questions and their communication skills. Being subtle about the same can help get reliable data and be crucial in either eliminating or selecting the applicant.To build a dedicated team of Python developers, the recruiter must consider good leadership skills and the ability to adapt to changing situations as the crucial factors in appointing a person to the designated position. An interview can be regarded as fruitful if the recruiter can probe the applicant to explore the basics and get a fair idea of their foundation related to the subject.
8.  **Analyze the candidate based not only on the technical skills but also their aptitude**  
    How valuable would the chosen employee’s contribution be to the company, to what extent can they inspire their team members, how fast can they adjust to a new working environment are questions that need to be answered before shortlisting a particular candidate. So make sure to include this in your “Python skills checklist”!
9.  **Shortlist candidates based on their experience, enthusiasm towards the field, and their scores in the interview and the technical round**  
    For a Python development company, the employees must have a certain amount of shared enthusiasm towards the field they are working in to avoid the monotony of a corporate job. Besides their experience in the area, the person must be open to new ideas and identify as a keen learner.After you consider all the possible aspects, round up the prospective entrants. Though the hiring task may seem a bit tedious, going through all of the steps isn’t all that time-consuming and is worth it in the end!
10.  **Sort through the list by upgrading your expectations by focusing on the industry knowledge of the applicant**  
     Tech markets are bustling, and there is rapid advancement in the field. Web app development is an ever-changing sector, so it requires a person who is well-versed with the tricks of the trade.**What Industry Knowledge can one Expect?**
     
     *   *   Recognizing at one glance the errors in a particular code.
         *   Being able to rectify errors in the shortest time possible.
         *   Keeping up-to-date about the changes and updates in the language.
         *   Having a fair idea about the works of other well-known developers.
         *   Handling projects of all sizes and being able to meet realistic deadlines.
     
     Once the final list has been generated, you can either proceed to the next step or set up a committee to review the portfolios for one last time before arriving upon an informed decision.
     
11.  **Call for a final round of assessment (not mandatory)**  
     The final round can be held as a short group interview so that the candidates can interact with each other. The recruiters can also analyze any strong points they had missed during the initial rounds. This method is not employed by many companies but can be deemed effective in choosing an excellent long-term employee.Lastly, finalize the decision and welcome the new member aboard! The above-listed points are some of the things that should be considered when hiring Python developers. As a programming language, Python has set a new horizon for technological development, and software companies have recognized the need to integrate it, in an absolute sense, in their daily functioning and the services offered.

### As the demand for Python developers soars, would you like to find out the relative cost of hiring one?

Most Python consultants would charge anywhere between $55 to $80 or $25 to $50 per hour on a freelance basis.

Given the benefits that these employees can bring to the table, the average mentioned salary is befitting. Financial negotiations are part and parcel of every company’s functioning, and these can help both parties arrive at a midground.

### Selecting the Python Developers on the Basis of the Project

If one is to look at the five basic characteristics that define any project, one can quickly rummage through the list of prospective candidates and pick the best suitable fit for the company. The five diverse project stuff to pay heed to are –

1.  **Budget of the project**  
    After analyzing a bunch of random projects, you can get a fair idea of the average amount of funds the company allows for a project of a particular size. Picking a candidate with an ideal salary expectation will help reduce financial hassle and be profitable to the organization in the long run.
2.  **The team is assembled**  
    Many tech teams remain constant for certain types of projects, and finalizing an aspirant who is an adjustable and helpful team player will be fruitful. Also, good interpersonal communication skills and management qualities should be scouted if you are looking for someone to head the entire operation.
3.  **Project goals are defined**  
    Many companies are specific to the type of project they take on, even if the services offered are diverse. Some specialized departments within the organization set particular standards to be achieved during each collaboration, and finding a fit that can meet that benchmark is vital for smooth functioning.
4.  **Deadlines are set**  
    The ability to work steadily under pressure as well as being able to meet realistic yet tight deadlines can prove to be the deciding factor in hiring Python developers. Coding isn’t an easy task, and recruiting someone who has a knack for completing things in the given time should be sought after.
5.  **The creative stance of the company**  
    Finally, the company’s policies and take on each of the projects differ from their fellow organizations in the field. This defining aspect should be understood well by a prospective employee who will be handling the company’s clientele in the future.
