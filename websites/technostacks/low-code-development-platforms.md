# Top 15 Platforms For Low-Code Development

10 May 2022

Thanks to contemporary technology, even complex programs may now be created without spending a fortune, waiting for months, or employing numerous engineers. Moreover, you don’t even have to be a coder to design these apps. Many Best Low-Code Development Platforms allow you to develop high-quality software, websites, and apps without writing a single line of code.

As per a [Statista](https://www.statista.com/topics/8461/low-code-and-no-code-platforms/#dossierKeyfigures) report, the global low-code platform market is forecast to amount to approximately 65 billion U.S. dollars by 2027.

Platforms with little code make workflow automation simple, aid in streamlining corporate operations, and provide non-technical users with a lot of power.

Unfortunately, several Top Low-Code Development Platforms on the market offer deceptive promises, complicated UIs, and expensive service models.

The most exemplary list of the Low-Code Development Platforms for seamless development in 2022 has been outlined in this article. Let’s go for it.

### What is Low Code Development?

Programming languages, object-oriented ideas, frameworks, package repositories, and integrated development environments are all part of the traditional software development process (IDEs). In addition, the drag-and-drop capabilities provided by a simple graphical user interface make low-code programming easy (GUI).

The user interface of a low-code platform is composed of predefined components and templates. As a result, it’s easier for users to choose the modules that best suit their needs than to type a string of brackets and punctuation.

Users may customize their software a bit more than they could on a no-code platform because of the availability of low-code platforms. It doesn’t matter which of these techniques to software development you choose; both boost productivity and save time.

### Advantages Of The Low-Code Development Platforms

For a variety of reasons, low-code development is advantageous. It is possible to construct functioning applications and programs using low-code platforms for a fraction of the price of standard development environments. Because of this, they may be used by anybody to create their own applications with little or no coding experience. As a result, these tools facilitate the creation of new software, make it easier to distribute it, and help businesses embrace digital transformation.

**1) Reduced Costs**  
Platforms for low-code development save development costs. By using simple-to-use technologies, the typical organization was able to avoid employing two engineers. There is less need to hire more programmers because of this software development method.

**2) The Rate at which New Features are Implemented**  
Delay of projects is a common problem in IT initiatives. This is a staggering number, especially in light of the increased demand for businesses to be flexible and responsive to shifting market circumstances.

Pre-built integrations and other tools are included in these solutions to speed up development. Companies may easily construct prototypes using these tools to test out new concepts. They may then test and refine the idea without the need for developers to become involved.

**3) Improved Business Agility**  
Firms confront fierce competition from companies, many of which are startups, that utilize technology to define their advantage. It is easier for businesses to adapt to changing market circumstances and stay competitive using low-code technologies.

**4) Software Development is becoming more Democratic**  
Development is no longer confined to the IT department, thanks to the use of these technologies. As a result, they help to break down barriers between departments and promote communication across the whole business.

Any department may use the tools to develop new apps. With so many people using it, there are likely to be a plethora of innovative ideas.
