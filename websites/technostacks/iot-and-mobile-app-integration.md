# Predictions For the Future of IoT and Mobile App Integration

15 Feb 2022

The Future is filled with Technology! Every passing day there is a new technology coming up or an old one getting advanced updates. Two such technologies that have changed our world and would be completely transforming our world in the next few years are IoT and Mobile Applications. Both of these technologies and industries are booming high and are expected to give you a huge ROI as well.

The [Statista Digital Market Outlook](https://www.statista.com/forecasts/1262892/mobile-app-revenue-worldwide-by-segment) estimates that worldwide mobile app revenue will increase over the next few years and overall will reach around 613 billion U.S. dollars by 2025.

Another [Statista report](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1101442/iot-number-of-connected-devices-worldwide/) predicts that the total installed base of Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices worldwide is projected to amount to 30.9 billion units by 2025, a sharp jump from the 13.8 billion units that are expected in 2021.

All of us have heard about IoT and Mobile App Development. The development of these two technologies has led to a huge revolution in the way we use Technology. With the help of these, we can have the entire world on our gadgets without the need to go anywhere. Since both technologies are powerful and booming on their own, we are going to witness IoT in the Mobile App Development Industry.

The rising requirements for IoT-enabled mobile apps and effortless utilization are two fundamental factors why IoT app development solutions are swiftly maturing. Both high-end professionals and common people from multiple industries such as automotive, medical, retail, agriculture and many more are profitably leveraging IoT solutions.

Start-ups and professional companies are using Mobile IoT, i.e., they are using the latest technologies to develop smarter and advanced apps. Forward-thinking mobile apps can expand the competence and yield of a complex business process by taking the advantages of IoT. Whether making a mobile application more engaging or delivering higher performance in a niche, IoT saves your funds.

Let us explore how IoT and mobile applications are interacting right in this blog post.

### Mobile IoT for Automotive Apps

Almost Everybody you meet owns a car today. Therefore, Automotive apps are essential for both buyers and purchasers. Automotive Apps allow the customer to do other tasks rather than driving using IoT Solutions. And believe us when we say, with the speed of light, All automotive owners in the market are going to start developing their vehicles with respect to IoT Mobility Solutions. IoT and mobile application Integration will allow people to do the following tasks alongside driving –

*   Call Support of Roadside to help
*   See the amount of traffic and which road to take through real-time systems
*   Switch on/Enable the Online Anti-Theft Alarm

### Future of Integration of Mobile Apps with IoT

The continuous positive growth rate in both these industries has predicted certain trends of IoT and Mobile App Integration. The Future belongs to IoT services and customized IoT Mobile Apps. Read on below to see this prediction –

1.  **Online Shopping is the new trend** The primary sector to have IoT-enabled mobile apps is Shopping. The Shopping sector has customized IoT Mobile Apps to assure a better mobile shopping experience for its customers.To better understand the sentence stated above, let’s take the example of Amazon Go Shop. It is one of the customized IoT Mobile Apps that enable people to avoid the long checkout queues in departmental stores and make the billing process easy just by scanning a QR Code.
    
    The Amazon Go Shop allows users to experience a user and customer-friendly system with the help of its app and has helped all kinds of retail stores, whether old or new, to see a growth in their sales. This was one example of the many mobile apps in Industrial IoT.
    
2.  **Toughened Security** AI-enabled IoT Mobile Apps would be helpful in making the security modules more advanced and tough. Experts and Professionals are devising new ways to use IoT and mobile app integration in making security measures.In addition to this, constant work is also carried on looking out for new ways to look out to online issues in case the cybersecurity system collapses.
3.  **Say hello to the concept of smart homes and smart cities** The Government authorities have planned and carried out the placement of cameras and other types of devices to have a lookout at the people taking care of the traffic rules and watch out for people who break them.These IoT solutions are going to make sure that we catch the wrongdoers and the authorities cannot make wrong decisions as well.
4.  **Better Aspects of Data Security** With the introduction of enterprise IoT App development, there are chances to improve aspects of Data Security. There are a lot of talks about companies losing their data, and IoT, along with the integration of mobile apps, is going to protect Data Security.As companies start to invest in a mobile app development company along with IoT, it will improve the chances of their data being more secure.
5.  **Switching to Edge Computing over Cloud Computing** All of us know about the way Cloud Computing works. First, we have to transfer data to other devices and then have to back it up to the Cloud. But before data is uploaded to the Cloud, the data that is transferred to the Cloud is organized into proper files and folders. The entire process of data being organized and uploaded to the Cloud is known as Edge Computing.Edge Computing is considered better as it helps in managing and organizing huge pieces of data and sending it across the other devices.
6.  **More Customization and Better Personalization**As stated above, the need for IoT solutions is increasing, which in turn is increasing the need for more and more user responsive and user-friendly apps. Therefore, owners are coming up with the best customization features to let their users/customers browse through a lot of options. IoT can be of great help to build the best of customized and personalized mobile apps for their customers and provide them with a flawless shopping experience.The present tech life requires a modern taste of both customization and ingeniousness. An increase in the rate of IoT will be a lot helpful to mobile app development companies to provide better customization and more uniqueness. The more businesses customize, the more they will be able to stay ahead in the competition.
