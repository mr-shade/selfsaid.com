# 18 Essential Tools For DevOps Adoption

15 Aug 2021

The harmonious relation between the developers and operations unit is one of the best things in the future. In this regard, DevOps is well known for exponential e increasing the efficiency of the project while sticking to the project guidelines.

DevOps tools complying with the DevOps practices have been quite popular over a long time because of the speedy product management, communication, and collaboration between software development and operations.

DevOps market value is going to reach around [$12.85 Billion by 2025](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-development-to-operations-devops-market).

Most of the software development processes like conflict management, deployment, dependency management, and other manual efforts are possible with the involvement of DevOps. So, let’s get initiated with the discussion regarding the top DevOps tools that are worth trying.

### List of DevOps Tools that can provide the precise support

1.  **[Git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/code-with-git) (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)**Instead of just focusing on just one of the future source code control tools, namely GitLab, GitHub, or bitbucket, it’s worth getting an idea regarding the overall value of Git in the form of DevOps tools. According to many developers, Github is the best place for developers to share open-source projects while collaborating around shared repositories. October 2020 statistics suggest over 60 million new repositories in 2020 mention over [56 million total developers use GitHub](https://octoverse.github.com/).
    
    Bitbucket and GitLab are purpose-built for the enterprise focused on helping engineers across the different deployment, release testing, and shipping code faster. Besides, the tool does it reliably. There is a basic difference between Git and the other version control systems in tracking the file systems recording changes made to the system at any time. Besides, it is beneficial for the crucial alignment between all development and IT teams. That said, it can work favorably for visibility into development pipelines and communication across engineering teams.
