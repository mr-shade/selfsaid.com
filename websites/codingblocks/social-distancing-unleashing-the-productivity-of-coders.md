Social Distancing can expose you to many unpredictable fears that can tamper with your mental peace. Everything coming to a standstill is explicitly affecting the movement of the education of the students. Many students are anxious about the uncertainty of the future and the repercussions it will bring along. Engineering students are also prone to distress and agitation as the classes, as well as placement procedures, have come to a halt for now.

Here's a small task for y’all! Think for a minute and jot down some points on how are you spending your social distancing days and what is keeping you preoccupied always. Once you are done with reflecting and if you come up with the understanding that you are not pulling out a very productive routine, you can continue reading!

We need to understand the reason behind the decreasing productivity of people nowadays!

There is a very interesting theory by Walberg, known as Theory of Educational Productivity, that postulates that the behavior and cognition of a student are influenced by his/her immediate environment. Social behavior plays an essential role in delineating the amount of productivity. The peer pressure of co-existing in social media platforms has resulted in upholding a perpetual presence in these spaces. In these serious times, we need to take a momentary escape from Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc. and try to breathe in a space of productivity.

**Social Pressure of Being on Every Channel!**

**What can you do to keep yourself occupied with productive work?**

·         **Arrange a Right Learning Ambience-** A comforting environment to work around is better than a shaggy one. Therefore, decluttering your room and working/learning space is refreshing to commence your work.

·         **Make a Plan-** You need to organize your daily routine until the COVID-19 crisis cools down a little. This will help you to wake up with a sense of purpose and you would feel positive in these disrupting times.
