Indian Engineers today face the negative consequences of the huge chasm between the theoretical knowledge imparted by various educational institutions and the practical knowledge required by the tech industry. According to the **Economic Times**, the Indian IT Industry requires skills that most engineering graduates lack. A majority of IT firms claim that most engineering alumni have thorough theoretical knowledge but lack the industry specific skills.

## How to bridge the gap?  

We, at Coding Blocks realize the essential reason and result of the skill-gap issue and attempt to take every possible measure to help students bridge this gap. Over the years, Coding Blocks has been able to help students learn skills and get placement offers much higher than any average college placement drive would provide. For instance, one of our students, studying in a Tier-3 college, whose average CTC would have been 6L through college placement, got an offer of 36L after completing Algo ++ course. In an attempt to keep helping many such students, Coding Blocks has launched a new initiative, an Income Share Agreement Program, called the Career Bootcamp.

## What is Career Bootcamp?  

The Career Bootcamp is an **intensive 6-month online training program** designed with the aim to help students realize their true potential and learn IT specific skills. The course would allow students to start from the scratch and progress towards becoming a professional software developer. Software Development is one of the most in-demand skills in the IT industry today and with Career Bootcamp you can master this skill easily and efficiently.
