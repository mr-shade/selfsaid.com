Crack Flipkart Interview 

## Interview  1:   (1 hour)

**Q1.** Discussion on Resume. (15 min)

**Q2.** Given N. You have to print all the numbers from 1 to n in random order (If you compile your    code again then it should print different order). You can use  Rand(x) , it will return a number from 1 to n.

Problem : If you use Rand(5) then let say it gives you 4 and you print 4 and if you again use rand(5) it should never give 4. You have to code in such a way that it should never give you the value that has already occurred.

Original Problem : you are in a marriage and you have chairs 1 to n and you have to place chairs on stage such that probability of every chair is 1/x where x is no of chairs left at that point.

In every new marriage , you have to place chairs in different order. (25 min)

You need to write the codes on paper and dry run it on their test cases

**Q3.** 0/1 Knapsack Dynamic Programming problem.

Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val\[0..n-1\] and wt\[0..n-1\] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the maximum value subset of val\[\] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or don’t pick it (0-1 property). (20 min).

You need to write the codes on paper and dry run it on their test cases.

## Interview 3. Personal Interview Round (50 min)

Q1. Given chess board and knight and starting point and ending point of knight. What is the minimum number of steps knight will need to reach ending point.

Write code on paper and dry run it.

Q2. Given a tree type hierarchy of a company.You arranged a party. Every member has some positive points that you will get when they will come in your party. If you invite a particular level the you cant invite the level that is immediately above and below of it.

Like if you invite people from level 3 then you cant invite people from level 2 and 4.

What is the maximum no of points you can get by arranging a party.

You need to write code and dry run it on their test cases.

## Coding Round (90 min To solve 3 question)

Q1. Given a string having brackets of 6 type ------>  ( ) { } \[ \]. Check whether given sequence is balanced or not.

Q2. Given a string 1 (containing many words separated by spaces) and given a string 2. You need to find how many words from string 1 are anagram to string 2.

Q3. Dynamic Programming problem similar to matrix chain multiplication.
