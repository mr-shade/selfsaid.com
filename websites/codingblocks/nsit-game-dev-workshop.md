Last weekend, in collaboration with **IEEE Student Chapter, NSIT**  
we conducted a Game Development workshop at Netaji Subhash Institute of Technology,  
Dwarka, New Delhi.

This was among the multitude of workshops we have been conducting recently  
at various colleges all over Delhi on themes like _Game Dev_ and _Android App_  
_Development_.

The workshop was conducted by our very own game development expert  
**Prateek** who has made popular games like _**Modi Run**_ and  
_**Flappy Singers**_ and whose gamified Resume is famous.

At the workshop, Prateek showed first a simple _Pokemon_ game  
where the player has to move from left to right without  
hitting the evil Pokemons.

Afterwards, a more advanced game was also developed, which used  
platforms and gravity. This was a game similar to the popular cult-favourite  
game _Mario_.

For the benefit of the workshop attendees, so that they can  
take a look at the source code, even after the workshop, and  
also for anyone else to be able to see the code of the games,  
Prateek has made the repository open on **Coding Block**'s  
[github repository](https://github.com/coding-blocks/nsit-game-workshop15)

You can take a look at the source of the game, and if you wish to  
feel free to make a Pull Request to improve the game. We'd love  
to include your additions :)
