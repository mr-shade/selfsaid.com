> _"The employability of Indian engineers continues to be painfully low with more than 80% of engineers unemployable for any job in the knowledge economy, reveals Aspiring Minds’ National Employability Report."_  
> _\- Times Of India_

According to a report by [Aspiring Minds](https://www.aspiringminds.com/research-reports/national-employability-report-for-engineers-2019/), 80% of engineers in India are unemployed. India is facing a massive skill-gap problem with more than 15 lac engineers graduating every year, but only a few possessing the skills required in the industry now.

**How can engineers be trained for future jobs?**

> _"A study by the analytics firm [Aspiring Minds](https://www.aspiringminds.com/research-reports/national-employability-report-for-engineers-2019/) found that only 4.8% of candidates could write correct logic and less than 1.4% could write correct code."_

**What is the problem with India’s engineers?**  
  
The reason for this skill gap is the absence of experience in the relevant skills that are required for emerging tech jobs. According to the Developer Skills report of an online learning platform, there is a strong mismatch between the frameworks/ skills required by the corporate world and the ones being learned by students in college.

> _It has been revealed that close to 80% of the engineers blamed a lack of focus and hands-on coding experience for this situation._

**What is a feasible solution to this problem?**

[Nagarro](https://www.nagarro.com/en) and [Coding Blocks](http://codingblocks.com/) have collaboratively come up with an initiative called [Career Bootcamp](http://bootcamp.codingblocks.com/). This Bootcamp aims at making the students skill up in the programming domain, while also offering them a job! **Yes, you heard it right!**

**Wow! So what is [Career Bootcamp](http://bootcamp.codingblocks.com/) really?**

[**Career Bootcamp**](http://bootcamp.codingblocks.com/) aims to train young engineers and make them industry-ready while they are still on campus. This training is being conducted by [**Coding Blocks**](http://codingblocks.com/), one of the best Programming training centres in India. Mentors from [IITs](http://www.iitd.ac.in/), [IIITs](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/), [DTU](http://dtu.ac.in/) and similar premier colleges will train students on Data structures, Algorithms and other advanced concepts in programming. Hands-on coding and Placement drive prob­lems are done at lengths to ensure optimal learning. This Bootcamp is especially for the **Third Year and Final Year B.Tech students**.

**What is the duration of this Bootcamp?**

The Bootcamp will start on **20th January, 2020** and will end in the **first week of May 2020**. There will be **30 LIVE lectures**, and the students are required to give a **weekly commitment of 16 to 18 hours**.

**Awesome! How do I get enrolled?**

To qualify for the program, you have to take an **[Enrollment Test](https://hack.codingblocks.com/app/contests/1166)** where we will ask **Basic Aptitude and Coding Questions**. The test is conducted every **Saturday** from **06:00 PM - 11:00 PM** which consists of **15 Aptitude Questions** and **3 Coding Questions**. The test will be conducted on **[HackerBlocks](https://hack.codingblocks.com/)**. The shortlisted students will be informed.

**Do I have to pay something?**

**Zero. Zip. Zilch. Nada. Nothing.** The effective fee of this [Career Bootcamp](http://bootcamp.codingblocks.com/) is absolutely **Zero!** Thanks to [Coding Blocks](http://codingblocks.com/) and [Nagarro](https://www.nagarro.com/en). The Bootcamp program is sponsored by [**Nagarro**](https://www.nagarro.com/en) and [**Coding Blocks**](http://codingblocks.com/), so **15,000 INR** program costs a mere **5,000 INR** to the students ([Nagarro](https://www.nagarro.com/en) and [Coding Blocks](http://codingblocks.com/) pay **5,000 INR** each for every shortlisted student's program). What’s more, this **fee is refunded** once the student joins **[Nagarro](https://www.nagarro.com/en).**

**I am already in! What is the course structure though?**

We will start from the beginner level, dedicating lectures to Syntax, Arrays and Strings. Moving forward, we will start with simple algorithms like Sorting, Searching, Recursion and Backtracking.  Then comes the turn of Data Structures like Stacks and Queues, Linked Lists, Binary Trees and Graphs, and finally we will learn Advanced Algorithms that include Dynamic Programming, Greedy Approach and Tries, among others.
