Github and Open Source

When I started using Github , i was messed up with all the commands clone,push,commit etc . I wasted lot of time watching different videos , reading blogs but none of them helped out :/ So , I decided to write one blog that will help the beginners to start with their favourite projects on github❤

# **What is Github?**

****GitHub**** is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While ****Git**** is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface.

Now,without wasting more time take a look at this simplest guide for git ✔

Setup:

Download git for Windows- [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/)

Download git for Linux- [https://git-scm.com/download/linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

Download git for OSX- [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

## Step 1:

Fork your own copy of the project to which you want to contribute.

Forked copy of original project

On the right corner of the project , you will see the fork button. This step will create a new copy of the project that will be owned by you .

After fork , you will see __yourUserName/ProjectName__ as new repository in your profile .You will get something like this after fork-

## Step 2:

Clone the project on which you want to work.In GitBash(in desired directory), write clone command.

Usage : ****git clone**** __url__

__url__\- Clone url from forked copy of the original project.

Clone Url

## Step 3:

After clone , open the project in suitable IDE like Android Studio , Sublime.Now you can make desired changes in the forked copy on your editor . Always work on a new branch and don’t mess up the master branch.

To create a new branch- ****git branch**** __branchname__

To shift to new branch- ****git checkout**** __branchname__

To check all the available branches- ****git branch****

## Step 4:

After making changes in the forked copy , You can check the modified files using the command- ****git status****

To add all the changed files — ****git add -A****

To add specific file — ****git add**** __filename__

## Step 5:

Commit all the changes using the command —

****git commit -m****”__commit\_message__”

## Step 6:

Push all the commited files using the command —

****git push origin**** __branchname__

## Step 7:

Now you have done some changes in your forked copy of original project 🎉

To tell the author of the original project about changes you made you need to do is ****Make a pull request .**** __How to do that ?__

All you need to do is click on the New Pull Request button on left side of the github page .
