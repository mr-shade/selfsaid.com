Many companies like Microsoft, Sony, and Ubisoft have already invested in Indian game developers.

Gaming in the 90’s was mainly by the developers outside India and gaming projects which were promising were outsourced to these gaming giants. Now, with the increase in gaming in the past decade, game developers have substantially found a market with a promising growth. Hence, many Indian based gaming companies have come up as well.

Gaming has also changed a lot in the past decade as well. The quality of the graphical content of the games has been drastically increased. Not only that, there has been emphasis on structural quality, motion control and the plot story of the game as well.

With the advent of mobile gaming as well, things have taken a steep turn towards the upside. Smartphone gaming has revolutionised the gaming industry. The need for developers is increasing day by day. Be it any platform, console, PC or mobile the industry has a bright prospect for anyone willing to take up game development seriously.
