The Education Industry of India has been working in a repetitive manner for decades.  The education space in the Engineering institutions follows a similar procedure to impart knowledge to the students. It might be debatable that the method is outdated as there is a high demand-supply gap in the industry.

The integral loophole lies in the fact that the learning process of engineering institutes is unable to solve the skill gap problems. The skills that an IT firm hunts for in an applicant is lacking these days, which cultivates the reason for increased number of unemployable in the IT industry. Coding Blocks has been working on this particular subject since 2014. What did it all take? It took appropriate and exhaustive research to dig out the discrepancy in the system!
