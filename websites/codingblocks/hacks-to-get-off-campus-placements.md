With lakhs of students taking the JEE Mains and JEE Advanced every year, and the number being on a constant rise, the competition is fierce. Each one of us take the exam with a dream to land into the top Engineering colleges like IITs, IIITs or NITs, but despite hard-work and determination, not all of us get into a TIER I college given the immense competition. So, what about students like us, students who dream and are capable of achieving the dreams, yet do not get the best opportunities due to certain reasons? Aren’t we worthy enough? Absolutely Not! We are just as worthy and capable as any TIER I college student out there and deserve the same opportunities. We won’t allow one test or exam to define our future and take away our dreams from us.

Though we might not get On-Campus placement opportunities as good as our peers from TIER 1 colleges, but that should never be a reason for us to feel disheartened about our future. After all, On-Campus placements are not the sole option available in the placement market. This is where Off-Campus placements come into the picture.

Benefits of Networking

_Though there are various ways to network with people, one of the best yet least appreciated is the power of networking through LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a social platform which allows professionals to connect with like-minded people and build a hive of networking._

LinkedIn as a platform is very novel and has a lot of arenas yet to be discovered. Thus, it gives users a fresh platform to explore networking and form links with employees from their dream organizations. Such connections enable people, in particular freshers, to learn and understand a lot about the company’s values and working environment.

Being a rather unexplored platform, LinkedIn yet remains a space which is uncrowded and open for everyone willing to take that extra unconventional step towards success. A friend of mine sent over two hundred **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/school/codingblocksindia/)** requests for referrals and received only ten responses. Though, the number of responses were less, but one of those ten referrals helped him bag a job at Amazon. This is one of the many examples of how connections can help an individual in growth. So, even though it might seem like a draining task, using LinkedIn is one of the best ways to use the power of networking to build your professional career.

Now that I’ve shared with you the best hacks for cracking any Off-Campus Placement interview, all you need to do is be disciplined, follow the right path, and use the correct hacks to turn your dreams into a living reality.
