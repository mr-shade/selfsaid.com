It was during May 2018 when I received a message regarding the [application form](https://codingblocks.com/campus-ambassador-program.html) for Campus Ambassadors(CAs). I filled the form and awaited their response. Within a few weeks, I received a call from [Jatin Virmani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jatin-virmani-6a8650b8/) (Operations and Business Development at Coding Blocks) for an interview. He shared the responsibilities of a CA. I got even more excited to start working as soon as possible. Around the end of May, I received the offer letter and that’s how my journey began as a Superhero!

As a Campus Ambassador of IGDTUW, Delhi, I have helped [Coding Blocks](https://online.codingblocks.com/app/courses) to conduct workshops in my campus, publicise about their events and courses and most importantly answer the queries of students regarding the various courses available, helping them decide the course suitable for them and following up with them on the same. Coding Blocks SuperHeroes has been an awesome experience so far. It has given me an opportunity to help the fellow students of my college, network with people from different colleges and interact with the amazing mentors. One of the major role in making the Campus Ambassador program a huge success is played by Jatin Bhaiya. ️He praises the superheroes even after completing minor tasks which is a huge motivation! 😄

However, CA program is not all about work. 😝 The mentors at Coding Blocks also organise outings/meet-ups for  the superheroes. There were two outings organised recently- one to Adventure Island and the other one to Smaash! Along with this, we are often rewarded with goodies and stickers too. 🌟

Getting acknowledged for the work is truly the best feeling! I became ‘Superhero of the month’ for June 2019. Thank you Coding Blocks for the same. I will continue to work with the same enthusiasm in future too!

Yayy!!

Apart from the CA program, Coding Blocks has helped me remarkably. I did an Android development course mentored by Harshit Dwivedi sir (Google Developer Expert for Firebase, GSoCer, GSoC mentor, Speaker at DEVOXX Belgium and instructor at Coding Blocks). The course helped me with strengthening the basic concepts, followed by learning the advanced topics. Every topic was covered by building a demo app simultaneously which helps in making the concepts clear. When the course ended, I continued working on my personal projects. Along with that, I was able to contribute to a few open source organisations by adding functionalities/resolving bugs of already existing Android applications. After a few months of practise, I took up and completed two freelance Android applications.

I also enrolled myself in Interview preparation course mentored by Garima Chhikara ma’am (Masters from IIIT-Delhi, Instructor at Coding Blocks) and Arnav Gupta sir (Co-Founder coding-blocks, Android & NodeJS mentor, speaker at large conferences like JSFOO, DroidCon, FOSSASIA and OSDConf, Android dev at Zomato). The course guided me to prepare well for the internship interviews. I got an on-campus internship at Intuit and now a pre-placement offer from Intuit as well.
