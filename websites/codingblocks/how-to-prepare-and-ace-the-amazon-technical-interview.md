Founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, Amazon has now become the world’s most valuable public company. Started as an online bookstore in a small garage; Amazon has now expanded its business into e-commerce, music, entertainment, web hosting business, etc. Whether you want to listen to music or read a book or shop for clothes or watch a movie; name any service, Amazon has got you covered. With a mind-blowing worldwide presence, Amazon is now the world’s largest online retailer across the world. With dozens of offices operating in over 30 nations across the world, Amazon is a hub of opportunities for students and professionals, in particular from the field of engineering and technology.

Though the most preferable choice for almost all engineering graduates, it is not a cakewalk to be hired at Amazon.

_In 2019, Amazon received over 2 lac job applications for 30k job openings._

Amazon has multiple levels of hiring processes. The process begins with an online assessment to test the candidates’ work styles and leadership qualities. Amazon gives considerable weightage to its _Leadership Principles_ and looks for the same qualities in each candidate as a prerequisite. The online assessment is then followed by a **_telephonic interview_** to test behavioral aptitude. Once the first two rounds are cleared, you get to sit for the in-person interview at Amazon. It is during the in-person interview that the candidates are interviewed for technical rounds.

## _Following are some topics that are needed to ACE the Amazon Technical Interview:_

· **Know a Programming Language** - Familiarity with any programming language like Java, Python, C/C++, or Ruby is a prerequisite to perform well and succeed.

· **Learn Data Structure & Algorithm** - A good understanding and learning of [_Data Structures & Algorithms_](https://online.codingblocks.com/courses/data-structures-and-algorithms-online-course) take you a long way when it comes to the technical interview of Amazon.

· **Code like a Boss** - Get ready to be asked to solve real-world coding problems on pen and paper while sitting for the [**_Amazon Technical Round_**](https://online.codingblocks.com/courses/interview-questions-for-big-companies).

· **Know how to Design Software** - Learn how to write and make good software designs in an object-oriented way that makes software extensible and maintainable.

· **AI & ML will take you a long way** - Expect basic questions to be asked on [_Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning_](https://online.codingblocks.com/courses/machine-learning-course-online).

· **Ask the right Questions** - Ensure to ask the right questions. [_Interviewers at Amazon_](https://online.codingblocks.com/courses/interview-questions-for-big-companies) believe that candidates should not only give the right answers but also ask the correct questions.

· **Ace Soft Skills** - Soft skills are never not important. When you are interviewing for Amazon; you need to market your skills and capabilities. If you have skills, ensure to have the confidence to be able to exert and showcase your skills to the recruiter.

Now you may think that that is a lot of preparation you need to do, but that is not all. In fact, the real test begins afterward. After clearing the first few rounds of the interview; you are pushed to your limits with the **“bar-raiser” round**.

## What exactly is a Bar-Raiser Round?

Recruiters at Amazon believe that a new employee should not only meet but raise the already set bar of the employees. The bar-raiser round is to keep you on your toes and test your creativity and innovation. It is to assess your ability to fit in the Amazon culture, to gain from it, and to add more than it already has.
