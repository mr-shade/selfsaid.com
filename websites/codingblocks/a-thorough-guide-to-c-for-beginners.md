Whenever a tech-enthusiast thinks of exploring the field of programming, the first major question is about the language s/he should learn. There are various functioning programming languages in the world; some of the most famous being C++, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. Now the question is from where to begin?

  

C++ is considered to be a truly good starting point for beginners when it comes to learning a programming language. It helps students learn the foundation of computer language and coding.

## What is C++?

Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979, C++ is considered to be one of the oldest programming languages in the tech world. It is a general-purpose project-oriented programming language. C++ is the foundational language for various important technological advancements.

## Where is C++ used?

C++ is centered around huge system execution and is thus used in a variety of small and big programs. This incorporates, however, isn't restricted to, web game development, animation, console games, medical software, MRI Scanners, etc. C++ is also used in internet browsers including Chrome and Firefox.

## Why should you learn C++?

· Despite the emergence of various [programming languages](https://online.codingblocks.com/courses) like Java, Python, etc., C++ continues to hold a significant place in the tech world.

· It is one language that familiarizes you with computers and programs like none other. It also helps you understand the computing structure, architecture, and theories.

· Almost all other programming languages including Java and Python are built around C++. Thus, learning C++ acts as a foundation for you to easily dive into learning other programming languages.

· Knowledge of C++ sets you apart in the tech world. Various big-wigs like Amazon, Adobe, Facebook, etc. need C++ developers to work on their programs.

· [**C++ programmers**](https://online.codingblocks.com/courses/c-plus-plus-online-course-for-beginners) are paid well and their salaries are expected to rise in the coming future with increasing dependence on web browsers.

## What are some important C++ terms to know?

· **Keywords –** Keywords are predetermined words that are used to identify objects and variables in codes.

· **Variables –** Variables are values with names or identifiers.

· **Strings –** Strings are objects with which one can perform functions in C++.

· **Operators –** Operators are symbols operating functions and manipulating data.

· **Data Types –** Data Types are different forms of data that can be used in a program.

· **Objects** – An object is a collection of data in C++. It has attributes and methods.

## What are some platforms or communities for C++ Developers?

There are various platforms or communities for people with the same interests, hobbies, and/or professions. These platforms help them interact, learn from one another, and work on projects together. Following are some platforms or communities for C++ Developers:

· GitHub

· Stack Overflow

· Reddit

· Web Developers

· C++ Meetups
