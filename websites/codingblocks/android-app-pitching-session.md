Midway through our _**Pandora**_ (Android App Development) and _**Elixir**_ (NodeJS Fullstack Development)  
courses, we have a _pitching session_ where the students make some projects no ideas of their choice  
and demonstrate them to the rest of the class.

Recently we had the pitching session of the **Pandora 2016 Fall** batch, and we got  
some amazing apps pitched by students.

There were ideas like _Movie Review Aggregator_, _Movie Ticketing App_,  
_Tilt Game_, _Distress Alert_, _Password Manager_ and many other innovative ideas.

The **Password Manager** app built by _Piyush_ and _Abhishek_ was adjudged best  
for tackling a unique problem and the innovative algorithm behind it.
