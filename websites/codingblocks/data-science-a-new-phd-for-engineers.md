According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/#18a9ef3360ba), **we produce 2.5 quintillion bytes (**2.5** billion gigabytes) of data every day** at our current pace and the main reason is the Internet of Things.

Here is what all happens in 1 minute in our world -

*   Google conducts **3,877,140** searches.
*   Amazon makes **$258,751.00** in sales
*   Tinder users match **6,940** times
*   Uber takes **1,389** rides
*   Spotify streams over **750,000** songs
*   **12,986,111** texts sent
*   Twitter users send **473,4000** tweets
*   YouTube users watch **4,333,560** videos
*   Snapchat users share **2,083,333** snaps  
    and chats

> So much data in TBs has been produced until you read this line.

Data is very important and crucial. We care about the data stored even in our small mobiles. Now the question is:

*   How the companies analyse this large amount of data?
*   Who make value out of this data?
*   How they process it- for recommendations and automation?
*   Who provides this valuable and useful data to Machine Learning programmers to write algorithms to be able to effectively use them?
*   Who cleans and validates data to ensure accuracy and uniformity?
*   Who identifies these patterns and trends in data, interprets the data to discover new industry opportunities?

The answer to all the above questions is **"THE DATA SCIENTIST"**.

## Who are Data Scientists?

According to Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt, the author of Doing Data Science: "_More generally, a data scientist is someone who knows how to extract meaning from and interpret data, which requires both tools and methods from statistics and machine learning, as well as a human being. He/she spends a lot of time in the process of collecting, cleaning, and munging data, because data is never clean. This process requires persistence, statistics, and software engineering skills—skills that are also necessary for understanding biases in the data, and for debugging logging output from the code."_

In general word, we can say Data Scientist is the one who studies & analyses data broadly and integrates deeply with tools, to give it a proper shape, find patterns and trends in it, create algorithms and give some meaningful and valuable result from it.

**Data Scientists are highly educated.** According to industry resource KDnuggets, 88% of data scientists have at least a master's degree and 46% have PhDs-and while there are notable exceptions, a very robust educational background is usually required to develop the depth of knowledge necessary to be a data scientist.

## How to become a Data Scientist?

![](https://blog.codingblocks.com/content/images/2019/05/image-6.png)

*   You should love data, I mean real data, big data, an unstructured data and lots of data.
*   Next up in the list - Mathematics and Statistics must be your good friends, followed by Computer Science and Engineering.
*   You should have a good command on Python (not the snake, a language) and R language.
*   Love to work on Data Structures and Algorithms.
*   You should have an Intellectual Curiosity and Business Acumen, they are necessary to solve the business obstacles which are critical, and be able to identify new ways in which the business should be leveraging its data.
*   Hadoop, Hive, Pig or Spark are also very strong selling points and are heavily preferred in many cases. According to CrowdFlower, on 3490 LinkedIn data science jobs, Apache Hadoop is ranked as the second-most valuable skill for a data scientist with a 49% rating.
*   Machine Learning and AI- these skills will help you to solve different data science problems that are based on predictions of major organizational outcomes.
*   Data Visualization- as I mentioned about data generation above, that data needs to be turned into such format that is easy to perceive. As a data scientist, you must be able to visualize data with the aid of data visualization tools such as ggplot, d3.js, Matplotlib and Tableau. They give you the ability to work on data directly and quickly.

## How to start with Data Science?

## Scope of Data Scientist

![](https://blog.codingblocks.com/content/images/2019/05/image-5.png)

Since Data Scientists play with data, this makes this job the hottest trending and the most exciting job in the world. The demand has increased by 70% and is increasing day-by-day as new data is being produced in enormous amounts, and as data increases, demand increases. According to Team Lease staffing Agency, by 2020, India will confront a demand-supply gap of 200,000+ data scientists. The NASSCOM (The National Association of Software and Services Company) has proposed educational programs to incorporate big data and data science in engineering schools.

MNCs like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Oracle, Uber, Ola, Accenture, Air France, Airbnb, IKEA, Infosys, TCS, Fiat, BMW, PepsiCo, HCL Technologies, HP, Heineken, Robert Bosch, AT&T, Axis Bank, Huawei, Honda, Maruti, Hero, Royal Dutch Group, Swiss Bank, IBM etc need data scientists. They are also needed in Federal Corporation and Government Sectors or agencies like FBI, CIA, RAW, Ministries of different countries, United Nations, UNESCO, Red Cross etc.

According to Glassdoor the average salary of a Data Scientist is $113,436 and in India the average base pay of Data Scientist is **₹947,698**.

## Conclusion

Data Science is definitely new buzz in the Tech industries, it is growing very rapidly and one may say it is the backbone of companies which are based on customers and their data. To ensure this backbone works properly, companies are hiring data scientist and paying higher salaries because the aim of data scientist is provide better results in a more efficient ways.
