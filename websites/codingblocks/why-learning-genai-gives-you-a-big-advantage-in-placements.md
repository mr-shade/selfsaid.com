### **The Students Who Took the AI Route  and Got Hired Faster**

In every hiring drive we’ve conducted at Coding Blocks over the past year, a quiet pattern has started to emerge.

It’s not just the students who solved the most problems.  
It’s not just those with the highest grades.  
It’s the ones who **built something with GenAI** and could **explain it clearly** who were hired first.

They weren’t AI experts. Most didn’t have a background in machine learning.  
But they learned how to work with the right tools.  
They used GenAI to build smart, usable projects.  
And when recruiters asked about them, their answers stood out.

So why is GenAI making such a big difference? And how can you start, even if you’re not from an AI background?

> Let’s break it down.

## **Resume That Stood Out**

In one of our placement drives earlier this year, a final-year student submitted a project called **JobSage**.

It wasn’t a complicated deep learning model. It was a simple web app.

You uploaded your resume. You pasted a job description.  
The app gave you a score, highlighted mismatches, and suggested edits using a local LLM running on **Ollama**.

The recruiter paused.

“You built this yourself?”

“Yes,” the student said. “It uses semantic search with **ChromaDB** and a basic prompt pipeline. It helped me apply to fewer companies but get more callbacks.”

He got the offer.

That’s what GenAI does today. It **doesn’t replace your learning**. It helps you build things that solve real problems faster, better, and more visibly.

## **From Hype to Hiring**

We all hear the buzzwords — ChatGPT, LLMs, vector databases.  
But the real shift is happening in interviews and hiring discussions.

Recruiters are asking:

*   Have you explored AI in your projects?
*   Can you use GenAI tools to improve development speed?
*   Do you know how to build systems that can reason, search, and respond?

In our Coding Blocks hiring drive, students who said “yes” to those questions often made it straight to the final round.

Not because they had years of AI experience. But because they **showed the curiosity to learn and apply something new** and Gen AI is very new.

It’s not a bonus skill anymore.  
It’s becoming a core part of how modern engineers work.

* * *

## **What Tools Are Students Using?**

Let’s keep this simple.  
You don’t need to master AI from scratch. You just need to know how to use the tools that already work.

Here are some of the tools our students used during recent placement drives:

### **1\. Ollama**

Ollama lets you run models like Llama and Mistral **locally on your machine**.  
Students used it to build AI chatbots, code reviewers, and personal productivity apps. No internet APIs. No privacy concerns. Just offline intelligence.

### **2\. ChromaDB**

Chroma is a **vector database** that lets you store and search embeddings. One student built a “smart notes search” tool that could find relevant content from handwritten PDFs. When she explained the architecture in her interview document embeddings + metadata tags, it made an immediate impression.

### **3\. LangChain**

LangChain helps you build logic around prompts.  
It’s like writing code that thinks.  
A student created a personal career guide using LangChain and a set of pre-fed documents, including company JD PDFs and role descriptions.

### **4\. Whisper by OpenAI**

Used for **speech-to-text**, Whisper helped a student build a voice-controlled coding assistant.  
It was just a small tool, but it demonstrated their ability to **think beyond the keyboard** — something product companies love to see.

## **How GenAI Changes the Way You Learn**

The students who succeed with GenAI don’t just add a feature.  
They change **how** they approach building and learning.

Instead of following tutorials line by line, they:

*   Ask clearer questions
*   Explore faster iterations
*   Use AI to prototype ideas before building. ding
*   Focus more on **why** something works, not just **how**

One student built four different app versions in three weeks because he used AI tools to test design ideas and fix bugs.

Another rewrote their resume four times using a GenAI prompt pipeline — and ended up with a version that landed interviews.

In short, **GenAI makes you faster, sharper, and more prepared** for real-world work.

## **Why Companies Are Paying Attention**

From startups to large firms, hiring managers are noticing a shift.

They’re no longer just looking for Java or Python expertise.  
They’re looking for candidates who:

*   Show systems thinking
*   Use modern tools effectively.
*   Can collaborate with AI, not just humans

When you show up with a portfolio that includes AI-driven projects and you can explain your thought process, you **signal that you’re ready for the next generation of software development**.

That’s what happened in our Coding Blocks placement rounds.

Several offers were extended simply because students showed working demos of GenAI tools solving real problems, even if those tools were basic.

One student built a campus helpdesk chatbot powered by Ollama and served it on a local network. Simple idea, but powerful execution.  
And it worked.

## **How You Can Start - Even Today**

You don’t need to wait for the perfect course or mentorship.  
You can start learning GenAI right now, with what’s already available.

Here’s a simple roadmap to get you going:

### **Week 1: Understand the Basics**

*   What is an LLM?
*   What is a vector database?
*   How do prompts work?

### **Week 2: Pick One Tool and Build**

*   Try Ollama for local chatbot building.
*   Use ChromaDB for semantic search.
*   Use Whisper for voice transcription.

### **Week 3: Add a Real Problem**

*   Turn your resume into a smart analyzer.
*   Build a coding assistant.
*   Create a study planner chatbot.

### **Week 4: Document and Share**

*   Post your project on GitHub.
*   Write about your process.
*   Prepare to explain it interview

That’s all it takes to get started. You don’t need a PhD. You need **curiosity, consistency, and the willingness to build**.

## **What We’re Doing at Coding Blocks**

To support this shift, we’ve made Gen AI a core part of our Fast Track programs and placement prep bootcamps.

During recent hiring drives, we guided students on how to:

*   Present GenAI projects confidently
*   Integrate AI with full-stack applications.
*   Break down complex concepts for the recruiter's.

We’re not here to hype AI.  
We’re here to help students use it **practically, responsibly, and effectively,** so that when they step into interviews, they’re **not just ready, they’re ahead**.  

## **Final Thought**

The future is not about competing with AI.  
It’s about **knowing how to build with it**.

Students who learn GenAI today are doing more than getting jobs faster.  
They’re building the foundations of a new kind of software career, one that’s shaped by intelligence, intention, and insight.

And companies are hiring them because of it.If you’re a student, the message is clear:  
**You don’t need to wait for the future.**  
It’s already here. And GenAI is how you enter i,t not just as a user, but as a builder.
