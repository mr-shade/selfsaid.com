I took the SAP Labs interview in August 2021 for the position of Developer Associate. It had a total of 5 rounds including a coding round. A total of 40 students got shortlisted for the interview rounds & all the interviews were carried on MS Team.  

**Round 1** was a Coding round. It consisted of 2 coding questions that had to be solved in 45 minutes. Both the questions were of easy level.

Question 1. Given an array, you have to print all the even numbers before all the odd numbers.

Question 2. Given an expression consisting of power and modulo terms. Basically, you have to use the fast power modulation method to find the value of the expression.

_Tip for similar questions: As the level of questions is quite easy, so you have to give the best-optimized solution at the earliest possible time._  

**Round 2** was a Technical round of 50 minutes. During this round, I was asked to give a brief introduction about myself. The interviewer then asked me some questions on OOPs.

Question 1. What is the difference between C and C++? Which one is better and why?

Question 2. What is Encapsulation and abstraction?

Question 3. What is runtime polymorphism? Explain with code. He wanted me to write the whole code and then explain it. After this, he directly jumped to DSA questions.

Question 4.How to reverse a linked list?  

I was able to answer all the questions correctly within the fixed time slot.    

**Round 3** was another Technical round. This round was fully DSA based and the duration was 35 min. During this round, I was asked to open any code editor and solve 2 coding questions.

Question 1. Function to check if a singly linked list palindrome

I gave a solution by finding the middle and then reversing the second part of the LL and then comparing the elements one by one. He was satisfied with my solution but asked me to give another approach that will not change the original linked list. After thinking for 2 min, I gave him a recursion approach. He was satisfied. I wrote the code only for the first approach as he understood what I meant to explain.

Question 2. Search in row wise and column wise sorted matrix

The interviewer asked me to directly give the optimized solution and write the code for the same.

I solved both the questions and also explained my approach. I was confident that I would be shortlisted for the next round. Within 1 hour, I got an email for the managerial round.  

**Round 4** was the Managerial round. The interviewer was very polite and humble. She made me feel comfortable. She started asking questions about my projects and also some general questions like:

Question 1. Which is your dream company? She also asked to justify why that is my dream company?

Question 2. How can you help people in this pandemic? Any ideas?

Question 3. As I am from ECE, she asked why I want to go into the software development field?

Many more questions were asked for around 35 to 40 minutes. At last, she asked if I had any questions for her. I asked her a few questions related to work culture, hierarchy in SAP, etc.

**Round 5** was the HR round which only took 25 minutes. This round was very relaxing. We had a very light discussion.

Question 1. Introduction

Question 2. Why SAP? What do you know about SAP? Any SAP product name?

Question 3. Where do you see yourself in the next 2 years?

Question 4. What’s your location preference?

After all the rounds were done, 12 students got the final offer, and I was lucky to be one of them.

Tips: Keep calm and answer politely with confidence. Keep a smile on your face. Practice DSA and you will rock.

Good Luck!
